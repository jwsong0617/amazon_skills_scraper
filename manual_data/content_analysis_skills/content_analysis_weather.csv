I'm a first time Alexa user and it kept giving me the wrong state for weather. You have to go into settings. Alexa's devices. And click where it says Online. Make sure your devices address is the address where it's located. That should solve the wrong loacation weather problem. Mine had just a zip code attached and it was in Bristol. Changed the address and now it works fine.,,,,,,,,,2,4,,," Like others have said it would be nice if Alexa also gave wind speed, but that is probably something that will be coming in the future. It would also be nice to be able to ask follow-up questions on the weather once Alexa gives you the general weather. Things like relative humidity, expected snow accumulation, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is because they didn't set their location in Alexa's settings. Once you do that it gives you the correct weather location. This is also true for the temperature. People are shocked when they hear the wrong temperature, but that's because they probably have it set for centigrade when they want it in Fahrenheit or vice versa.",,,,,,,,,3,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I was having trouble with Alexa giving me the weather in Celsius. I noticed she was getting the info from accu weather. So I downloaded the app for accu weather . When I fist went on the app it asked me if I wanted the weather in Celsius or Fahrenheit. I choose Fahrenheit and restated Alexa and now she gives me the weather in Fahrenheit. I hope it helps others that had that same problem 😀,,,,,,,,,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I too was getting the wrong weather forecast for where I lived. You need to physically change your address the Alexa app under your device name. Then it works perfectly.,,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Good way for me to check the weather on the go.,,,,,,,,,6,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This is great if you set your location correctly. I manually set it up through setting and it has been spot on since. Really great to start off mornings knowing how to dress up.,,,,,,,,,7,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you are having trouble getting the wrong weather reports, go into your Alexa app (or to Alexa.Amazon.com), click on the box in the upper left hand corner, go into Settings > (choose your device) > then set up your device location, time zone, and desired temperature units. You should then get the correct information.",,,,,,,,,8,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The weather app works perfectly for me. It tells me the same weather as the app that came standard with my phone. I just now can ask Alexa instead of checking my phone.,,,,,,,9,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No complaints here it works really well.,,,,,,,10,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Once set to the right location this app is great at getting today's forecast as well as things like ""tomorrow"" or ""this weekend"". You do have to set the location correctly which seems to mess a lot of people in the reviews up. To set the location go to Settings>(Choose Your Device from the List)>Scroll Down and Change Location.",,,,,,,,,11,3,,,However it fails for wind. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,2,,,Why doesn't it mention wind speed (for those who like to bike) and wind chills (for those souls living in the North)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,3,,,,"One problem is that it always tells me the weather for a place that is a 30 minute drive away in another city if I just say ""Alexa, what's the weather?"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,1,,,,"Despite having my exact address saved, the weather is incorrect. We're currently under a heat advisory and Alexa thinks it's only 85 F. It's been consistently wrong since I received my Echo View.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,2,,,,I don't want Denver's weather it is not always the same as our weather. I can even say Timanth Colorado which is a very small town close to us and it gives me their weather. I wish she could use a locater like smart phones do to give me the weather like they do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16,3,,,"Humidity is a big factor in the weather, especially in the summer. I wish Alexa would provide that detail as well as the temperature. And would it be much harder to add wind chill and heat index?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,2,,,"Really wish they would give wind chills, ""real feels"", and weather advisories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18,1,,,It doesn't give an update on pollen count or fall colors update .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19,1,,,,I'm getting a weather forecast for the North pole instead of where I live and I have updated my address several times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,2,,,,"We live in a decent-sized city within Los Angeles county (San Pedro), but Alexa - using our zipcode - gives us Anaheim's weather report - which is vastly different (inland vs coast). I'm also dismayed that I can't even GET a weather forecast for our city from her. Instead, we have to ask her for a &quot;Long Beach weather report&quot; each time, which is often multiple times a day...grrrrr.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Total,20,0,0,6,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
