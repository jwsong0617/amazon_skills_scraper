If your phone's sound is off, this basically is no use. Other than that, assuming your sound is on, this skill works fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In order for this skill to work, you have to set up your phone number with Alexa. First say ""Alexa, open Where's My Phone."" Then she will ask you if you want to set a phone number and all you have to do is say ""Yes."" Then she will ask for your phone number and you just tell her your phone number. Alexa will then call your phone to verify your number.",,,,,,,,,2,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Works great with my iPhone 6. Once set up, I saved the number in my contacts and activated the emergency bypass option. With the emergency bypass option my phone always rings when the specific Where'sMyPhone number calls me, even if it's on silent.",,,,,,,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,That way anyone at home who loses their phone can use it.,,,,,,,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,," You have to ask alexa to ""OPEN where'smyphone"" not just ""where's my phone"".

I even did a test call after verification. This is a very useful skill, especially for those that pile laundry on top of our phone and can't find it until all of the laundry is folded...wait, that's probably just me haha... At any rate, very useful skill. Thank you!",,,,,,,11,3,,,"This would be a great app if you can store multiple phone numbers in one profile. Is it possible?
