Remove the skill and add it again. ,,,,,,,,,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,,"""Alexa, tell Anymote to X my Y"". Would be nice to just say ""Alexa, X my Y"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I especially love turning the my tv setup off using 1 command while walking by.4,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Remember people - if you are trying to do this from your phone and you do not have an IR blaster built in to your phone it will not work. An IR blaster is not the same as bluetooth!,,,,,,,,,5,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"works, you just have to make sure the IR port from your device is aimed at the TV. ",,,,,,,,,6,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you need simple remote control app for your TV without spending money for hubs, this is exactly what you need.",,,,,,,7,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Use it with a Samsung tablet that has a IR Blaster.,,,,,,,,,8,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'm an owner of the AnyHome Bluetooth remote control sold by the AnyMote team and this skill works flawlessly with it ;),,,,,,,,,9,4,,,,,,,,,,,,"A tip to the developers is change the invocation word! It's too difficult to enunciate ""any mote"" as 2 words! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,5,,,,,,,,,,,Ok the whole thing needs more work but after some tinkering around I got it connected to Alexa (Echo Dot). Then connected fine with TCL Roku TV and other Rokus. The paid app is for advance users so dont write it off so fast. It is not for the home user but a person that understands home automation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To those that are having any issues: I promise you this works as you would want and expect.,,,,,,,,,12,1,,,,"Started setting up remotes on my iphone 6s using anymote app. The cable and sound bar worked, but it couldn't find the right remote for my smart TV.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,2,,,,,,,,,,,,Many words result in this - I went through 4 or 5 words renaming the button before finally finding one that echo would properly send over to Anymote. ,"First off, the long phrase you must speak to initiate an action makes you feel kinda stupid when pushing one button could accomplish the same thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,1,,,,Pairing with echo was not at all hard. However the AnyMote its self is not working or something. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I've spent hours trying to get this app to function. Alexa will understand some of the commands, but they won't work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,"So far commands only register if I create a macro. So if I create a macro that powers on my tv, named power and assign it to my tv remote. ""Alexa, ask anymote to power my television."" (device name in anymote must match command spoken) Works!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,1,,,,,"Too difficult to setup, difficult to find the right remote, especially for Sony, awkward with Alexa. A lot missing and a lot needs to be streamlined. Way too expensive for a poor device",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18,2,,,,So I've had this skill and my Amazon Echo for over a month now and so far I can get everything to work for a couple of days then I may not use it for a few days after and when I try and use it again it won't work. Even the Anymote app isn't that good. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19,2,,,,Can't make it to work witch my Echo Dot and AnyMote App on a Adroid Phone. The problem occurs by pairing those 2 devices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,1,,,,I have trtied all the commands with the right syntax. It still does not work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Total,20,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
