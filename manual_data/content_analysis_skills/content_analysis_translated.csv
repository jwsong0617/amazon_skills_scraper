In that respect, you'd be surprised how little efforts on your part can yield such large results in establishing rapport and understanding. Seen in this light, this unique and capable skill is a real boon.",,,,,2,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When I ask Translated to say something in Japanese, I get a recording of a native speaker saying it - not Alexa!
