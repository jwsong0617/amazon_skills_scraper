To quote a wise I.T. tech, ""Did you try turning it off and on again?""",,,,,,,,,2,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Once I understood how to set this up and what to say it works fine.,,,,,,,,,3,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What I did (in the hue app) was I named all my bulbs with abbreviations.,,,,,,,,,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alexa has trouble if you name HUE Lights & Rooms the same name in HUE App. Instead use the name of the Room you will remember ""Hallway"" & name Light ""Hall"". This fixes Alexa's conflict with multiple devices having same name (and you don't need to remember Light Name).",,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I tried for an hour to enable it on the app and asking Alexa to discover it. Nothing would happen. I must have pressed the bridge button a million times. Then I walked away. About a week later I enabled the skill on the website and bang. It showed 2 bulbs discovered. I grouped them as ""living room lights"" It worked right away.",,,,,,,,,6,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"You must say exactly ""Turn on ""scene"" in ""room."" Pretty much anything else won't work.",,,,,,,,,7,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We've been running Alexa to control our Hue lights in 4 rooms, one room with six unique lights. The key for this working in our house has been to create a custom group in Alexa for each Hue scene and bulb, and by listing them by name in the Alexa app it makes prety easy to scroll through the list of discovered bulbs and scenes to add just the right lights to each group you want Alexa to control. ",,,,,,,,,8,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This skill complements the Alexa/Echo Dot very well and gives your home a 'next century' feel. After seeing several negative reviews, I was concerned that it wouldn't work and initially it didn't. ",,,,,,,,,9,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Took me an hour reading reviews and Reddit to get scenes to work. Figuring out how to turn on/off and dim the lights was easy - getting scenes to work was awful but very rewarding once it worked!,,,,,,,,,10,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It looks like most of the reviews focus on the issues with the color bulbs. I'm using the white only bulbs and this has all the functionality that I want and need for this purpose (on, off, dim). Set it up last night in about 10 minutes (including Hue set up and linking to Alexa) with no issues. I'm buying more bulbs pronto.",,,,,,,,,11,1,,,,"As of right now, this is simply not functional. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,1,,,,It's also staggering to see Hue chiming in on the 5 star reviews while leaving the hundreds of people with problems in the lurch and not posting anything to their support site on how to troubleshoot this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,3,,,,"This workaround is okish for me but if i had other devices using hue or a ton of the color lights in my house i would have more trouble and more groups to create. Hue really needs to sit down and reconfi this. I should be able to say ""alexa turn on bathroom and set scene to nighttime""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,1,,,,Until they are able to provide clear and concise documentation for using scenes I can't recommend this to anyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,1,,,,I follow commands for scenes and it simply does not work. It can only turn on/off and dim lights. This is frustrating. It was the reason I got Echo for. This is simply not acceptable. It works with Siri with no issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16,2,,,,"I've spent hours attempting to use Alexa to trigger certain scenes.
