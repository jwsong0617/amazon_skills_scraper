This made it frustrating for both driver and passenger because when I got picked up the driver asked me to input my destination, but I didn't know how once my driver was matched, so then I had to look up my destination address; and driver had to input it on his end. This added an extra 2-3 minutes to the ride experience.",,,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,super easy to setup/enable and called a car to come pick me up within minutes. Love this service.,,,,,,,6,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This skill is so useful for my daily lyft line to work. Makes it easy to call a lyft hands free. I'm glad they added this.

Unable to use uber pool on Alexa. Unfortunately Uber has offered the Uber Pool Pass which allows a certain number of rides a month for a low cost and I have bought this. Would love to come back to Lyft if you could offer the same.",,,,,,,11,1,,,,Keeps telling me to set up my home and work locations even though I already did.

I have tried to uninstall everything and it keeps saying that I don't have a home or work address set up with I do! So frustrating.
