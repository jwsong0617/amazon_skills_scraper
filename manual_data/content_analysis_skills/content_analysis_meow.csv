It's an electronic cat."" Apparently, they had been searching for the cat that was loose in the facility.",,,,2,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The sound that Echo puts out is unprecedented! Each &quot;conversation&quot; sounds very real and left my 2 cats in complete amazement,,,,,,3,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My cats had more fun than I did!!!!,,,,,,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,I'm easily entertained by this. The cat couldn't care less.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It is fun but now one of my cats takes over I will go to ask Alexa something right after I say Alexa my cat interrupts me and takes oven. ,,,,,,6,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Once I start 'Meow', she will talk to it for a while before wandering off. Love it!",,,,,,7,5,,,,,,,,,,,lol.. drives my dogs crazy....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,5,,,,,,,,,,,"This is the height of skill design for Alexa. I'd like to see this paradigm extended generally to web, mobile and VR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,5,,,Love it play with the cats need a dog one!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I instantly felt guilty. It really freaked my cat out. That said, she shot toward it and began circling Alexa looking for the intruder. I can't tell if she likes it or if she feels threatened by it...",,,,,,11,2,,,,,,,,,,,"It seems like it randomizes cat sounds when you meow, which is a neat idea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,2,,,,I loved it and my cat went crazy for it. We had so much fun. But it would only play once. I tried disabling and reablin several times but it refused to work again. We were both so disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,3,,,It would be great but only meows twice. How about a full 30 to 60 seconds...?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Surprisingly fun. My cat was trying to figure out where this other cat was. Even talked back and forth a little. Certain meows like the angry meows really got her attention.,,,,,,15,1,,,,,,,,"Sure, ""conversation"" with 10+ different cat voices including angry ones. This is made by someone who doesn't understand cats at all and is just looking for downloads. Terrible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16,2,,,,,,,,"I was expecting a lot more, but after several tries, all I got was the same, ""Meow, meow."" Nothing more. Even my cat was unimpressed. This needs work sadly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,1,,,,,,,,Scared the life out of all three of my cats! Maybe fun for dogs!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18,1,,,,"I keep saying “Alexa, meow meow” and it suggests I download the skill “Box of cats” instead. I already have “Meow!” downloaded but Alexa just isn’t registering it for some reason. :/ Too bad, I wanted to talk to some cats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19,2,,,,,,,,"The cats are curious and interested, but there is no need to include the angry, hostile, distressed cat noises. These can cause unnecessary stress and ruin the overall experience. If these were not present, I would give 4-5 stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,1,,,,"The first couple times we used it we loved it. We enjoyed watching our dogs look for the cat. It meowed for about 5 minutes the first time, 3 minutes the second time & every time after that it meows twice & shuts off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Total,20,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,1,0,0,0,0
