R. Seehoffer,1,"The skill itself isn't bad--in fact I used it for a couple months without issue. My concern is that the pin code necessary to access account information, pay bills, etc is stored as plain text in Alexa's voice history list, and can be read by anyone who looks. 99% of people are not going to know how to go on Amazon through their PC and clear that history, or scroll through hundreds of entries and delete it from the Alexa app. This to me pretty much negates the security aspect of requiring a pin, and so I removed the skill.",2017-01-10,257b162a-8190-4db8-9fcc-b5fbdaa5e365,3.0,Capital One,1503627770.8015912,"Not a bad skill, but access pin is readable by anyone, even months after the fact.",27

It's just a little bit slow right now, but I'm sure that will improve.We are really eager for this skill to develop even further, e.g. search for transaction by merchant name, transfer funds between accounts, send a check, etc.  But even in the meantime, this saves the need to login the old fashioned way for basic info!",2017-03-26,235d41e7-1a09-44a7-8770-0bccecfe37b5,4.0,Capital One,1503627776.937122,The Promise of Alexa Realized,6

I also like the idea of being able to make a credit card payment, however, if you have already met your minimum amount due for the month and won't allow you to make an additional payment, even though there's still a balance, therefore you will have to use your app or log into your account online.

Jeff S.,1,"Sometimes technologies can match up so well as to become nearly perfect solutions for some of the most challenging problems we face. Take the task of taking care of our elderly family and friends - Ask My Buddy steps up as one of those perfect solutions. It leverages Alexa's ""always on"" capabilities so that my blind 89-year-old father has the means to call out if his cell phone battery dies (which happened today), he falls or is otherwise in need of help at a time no one is around. This combination skill and service along with the voice-interface that Alexa provides gives my father freedom of movement and all of his family a greater sense of security.In fact, I think this company should be bought out by Amazon and incorporated into all Echo units by default since it offers such a vital service for anyone, not only the elderly, to send a quick message for help. It also isn't bad for Dot sales in that we are now buying 3 more Echo dots for various remote areas of the house to accommodate this skill's capabilites. Ask My Buddy rocks!",2016-12-28,57a85c23-9159-466a-ad94-fb137d69533e,5.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627869.264671,A Perfect Combination of Technologies offering Freedom of Movement and Peace of Mind,32
Angela McElvein,2,"I have mine set up for my mom who lives w me, so when I'm away from home she can activate if necessary.

Of course I knew she was fine sitting across the room from me. The kicker was that my husband out of town also called in not knowing it was a &quot;test/mistake&quot; and wanted to make sure everything was ok.

Brandon Slattery,2,"I'm giving 4 stars because I believe this may have pioneered an idea for Alexa that I'm all for- not only to be used as a life alert system, but for text messaging functionality in general.Although this doesn't fit a need for me specifically, I downloaded it interested in the functionality.  I enjoyed sending a text to my SO with a few words and adds a lot of novelty to the echo.That being said, I think the ask my buddy skill has been obsoleted with the integration of IFTTT.  I now set a trigger, I.E.- ""Alexa, trigger Send mom I love you text"" and IFTTT sends the text I pre-wrote to the number I define.  This is awesome...but I still want more.Using IFTTT, I've been able to send pre-written texts, and even call my own phone (find my phone) so the functionality is there.  How long until I can ask Alexa ""Call my secretary"" or ""send a text to Jim saying ""sorry brother, I'm gonna be a little late""  How long until I can use skype through alexa?These are the things we REALLY want.  The skill here may be obsoleted by triggers, but 4 stars for developing more useful applications than making fart sounds for this exciting technology.",2015-12-29,f72b673d-e7e6-4c4c-a4f3-13f686086327,4.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627869.375617,A step in the correct direction,84

Remlan,1,"Awesome app! I had one of the telephone boxes that require a sizable monthly service charges that continually increased in cost. That service took as long as five to ten minutes to respond, though it had no problem coming on (without using the cumbersome button necklaces or bracelets) in the middle of the night waking everyone just to be discovered to have been a case of a malfunction or accidently touching a button. The box hummedconstantly, lots of static and it ate electricity. I finally gave up and ended the service. NOW I have this. With two Echoes in my home I am always within voice range of Alexa! On a trial run, within 30 seconds, my hubby's cell phone rang with information that I needed help. I have him set as a voice answer on his cell phone and two others set to receive texts because that is what they use most often. Now everyone is happy because I can get immediate help.  If you can afford a small donation, they are pleased but if not, they only ask for a good review! As someone in poor health, I feel much safer than I did with the over priced box. This is a win win situation and it works VERY well! I am a retired nurse and highly recommend it for anyone with health problems who may not be able to reach a phone OR forgets to always wear that large button necklace or bracelet all the time. I feel better when alone and so do my loved ones. Highly recommended for anyone with health issues who may not be able to afford 40.00  or so, each month for something they may not ever use, or have access to. This is the best thing EVER!

F. R. Cox,1,This is such a wonderful service and quite a bargain when compared to the other Life Alert or Live Line type services.  I've found that these services charge you anywhere from $9.99 to $39.99 Per Month and do little more than Ask My Buddy does. I can attest to this because I paid one of them $39.99 per month for several years for my mom.  Bottom line is we want a service that if/when we fall we can call out and get some help from our friends or emergency services.  Ask My Buddy does this function very well through Alexa and is only asking $10 every 3 Months to help maintain their services.  It is well worth the money and I highly recommend!,2017-04-05,716dfa8b-6f22-4f88-a140-0ecf868f042d,5.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627875.7740278,One of Alexa's Best Skills!,11

Jude525,1,"I haven't had to use this in an emergency, but I have run a couple tests and the system has worked as hoped. Set up was incredibly easy.While it isn't a factor on the Alexa app, I have to say that the development team is excellent. After setting up on my Echo Dot I contacted the development team about using it on my PC and they were right there explaining what I had missed in the set up. They have followed up twice with me checking if I have questions on either device. You don't usually get service this good for paid apps!I have two conditions that make me prone to falls, but neither one is severe enough for my insurer to pay for a traditional emergency button. Although Ask My Buddy isn't the same as a  911 service, it does take some of the fear away from my being alone. Especially at night when I am tired and most afraid to fall.Finally, if like me, you can't afford the subscription service, consider making a one time donation to the team.

One thing I found a little confusing though is Ask MY Buddies ""Messages "" Page. I finally figured out these msgs arent for actual alerts but for scheduled TESTS.

Of course I let them all know ahead of time that I was doing a test.  I'm so impressed I'm going to buy an Echo for my mother.  The peace of mind of having this is priceless..  Thank you for such a wonderful App.  I honestly don't know why anyone wouldn't want this.

I was in alot of pain and couldn't get up. I remembered my Ask My Buddy skill, and I'm sure glad I did! I asked to call my Daughter and she was able to get to me and help. Turns out I tore my MCL and my knee just wouldn't let me get up. This skill is awesome and accurate. It's also not just for the elderly.

nancy,1,Awesome skill!! My husband has had some health problems in the last few years. Electronics and computers frustrate him. Echo allows him to give voice commands and this skill allows him to alert me at work if something is wrong. I told my sister because she works in an assisted living setting. She said this will be a great recommendation for the residents there. They are sometimes given an alert for their neck but it alerts the facility only and due to liability issues they can not help them if they fall. How nice it will be for them to alert their son or daughter to come help them?!?,2017-01-15,6da2fbd0-9937-4d32-a13b-29cfa7b28b5e,5.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627907.6319108,Recommend to everyone I see!,3
Meghan,1,"I have 4 year old children who my mother watches during the day at my house. We don't have a home phone and if something were to happen to my mom, my girls might not be able to find her phone and make a call in an emergency. Ideally if there was a life and death emergency, they would call 911, but I am not sure 4yos are a good judge of that and I am just as happy that they can use the app to alert an adult in our family and let us triage the situation if the adult with this isn't able to help. We have tested this a couple of times with them and it has worked well. Thank you so much for the direction and reminder pages on your site. It has all the information about how to use the app and I put them on the front of my fridge and next to Alexa so my kids could reference them in an emergency. The Alexa UI is such that for apps you have to use a somewhat unnatural phrase, but with the reminder cards, you have a better chance of remembering it. I think it is also important to practice this skill (having first warned any alert contacts) and keep the relevant phrases in your mind.I can see that this could have a huge impact for elderly people that want independence, but also might need to call for help verbally. This is a great idea and while I hope I never have to REALLY use it, it gives me some peace of mind that it is there if we need it.",2016-12-30,01e69bd0-a9a2-4e7f-99b8-65ed553a217d,4.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627907.668663,Could Really Help in an Ermergency,9

Widgeon,1,I have several serious illnesses that place me at risk for falling and other medical emergencies. Having Alexa with the Ask My Buddy app that allows me to simply say Alexa ask my buddy and then name one or all and have a text or phone call sent immediately  saying I need help is more security than I ever thought I would have.  As of yet I have not had to use it but I have tested it with family and friends and it works. It brings a sense of security when I am home alone.  This would be great for parents that have teenagers at home that might need  to contact a parent in an emergency or anyone else. It is an amazing app that sends for help when you need it .

This was by far the best customer service I have ever received.. Thanks to their persistence I got into Ask My Buddyand easily set up my Contact List. A good hint was put your own name and details on the and send yourself an alert to see how the system works. This is a non profit effort and I am impressed.

M. Richardson,1,This was one of the most important reasons I bought the echo dot.  I was so happy to have a far less expensive alternative to lifeline type products.  However I see from one of the reviews that this app will have a charge eventually.  I certainly hope that it isn't as expensive as the alternatives or I will be one unhappy customer.  I did have to contact customer service to set up the app as it kept refusing my sign in.  They responded very quickly and gave me a detailed list of instructions which did allow me access finally.  I really appreciated that! So only 4 not 5 stars because of the potential for an unknown charge in the future.,2016-10-23,cd7021e6-fc6c-43f6-b133-9a93c457d5a6,4.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627926.7822864,"Great service, but future charges??",6

I timed this at .5 seconds once and then when I saw Alexa processing the command with the spinning blue light it was under two seconds.Even though parents are not near a phone, being able to call is critical to life!

jjaquinta,1,"This can send an alert or message to a list of people you give by e-mail, phone or text.Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. As with any skill using a linked account, this is a little tricky to negotiate. It took me a few times and some puzzlement to work it out. I was a little leery giving it several contact methods for many people. I looked at the terms and conditions but they were typically long and cryptic. There was no clear statement that I could easily see saying that my info was not being sold. I blanked out my information after reviewing, but there was no way to delete your account.Usefulness: 3 out of 5. If you are buying an echo for an elderly relative, there can be some advantage to this app. It works well for the ""I've fallen and can't get up"" scenario. But not so well for just about any other scenario. Maybe when there are more Alexa devices out there and you can use this from your smartphone or car, there will be more use.It's also great if you want to spam or harass someone.Novelty: 4 out of 5. There have been one or two calendar integration apps. But this is the first general alert one. I'm happy to see that it sends fixed messages, instead of attempting low quality free format text. As a sender of canned messages go, this could be useful for a variety of things. Say if the web end could be connected up to IFTTT.Overall: 2 out of 5. I cannot, in good conscience, give this a rating based solely on quality. Up until a few months ago I was an Ethical Hacker, and got a very firm schooling in security and privacy. You can use this skill to set up several contacts with a variety of contact methods and then effortlessly blast out a message to them as often as you like. There is no opt-in. The only way the sender is identified is how they choose to be identified. There's no way, as a recipient, to stop the messages. Sure, if used as intended, it is beneficial. But there is huge potential with this for harassment and abuse.",2015-12-04,20dc8d9e-db63-425d-84b1-4bbc1c5c99b3,2.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627958.907943,"Mildly useful, but very open for abuse",10

The basic service will let you notify close family/friends in an emergency, and that's all most folks really need. Let the family members and friends you list as emergency contacts know that you've put them down to receive a text or voice call if you have an emergency.

Amazon Customer,1,"First, let me begin by saying that this app has been tested and works super fast for the contacts you set up. Second, for anyone who lives alone, with a disability of any kind, the elderly, and anyone who may have even undergone recent surgery and are needing that extra piece of mind for themselves and for their loved ones..install this!! There are bound to be times where you are not able to reach a cellphone or a security system button, but are still able to rely on Alexa to contact your Buddy app Contacts and this is the reason for such an important skill. I tested with all my contacts, I'm young and I had a fall a few months ago and had I had the My Buddy as a back up, it would have saved me a painful crawl to reach my cell. I cannot thank the team of experts enough for offering this skill with the Amazon echo devices. We surely hope not to have to use this, but thank you so much for offering this service so that when we do need it..we have it!!

Matt G,1,While it seems to work these things are frustrating:1. Maybe let people try the app first before asking them to commit funds.2. Once skill is enabled and you are taken tot the set up page there is no direct way through the skill on an iPhone to get back to the login page. The link can't even be copied in the skill description.

Bazinga,5,"FYI, for any potential users:  This app might be free, but you must pay for the ""Ask My Buddy"" service, which you don't find out about until AFTER you create an account. Extremely unhappy.  My elderly mother bought an Echo just for this service, and was led to believe it was free and it is not free.  The info, as we were in the process of signing her up, stated that if she couldn't afford to pay, that she could sign up for free, however there was absolutely no way possible to do this.  The fine print then goes on to reveal that they are a volunteer-based service and please be 'kind'.  They also discourage leaving bad reviews!  I'm sorry, but I think others should know about this false advertising. If I can help one person from buying an Echo just for this service (by being misled) then my time was worth it.  My anger here lies with the 'Ask My Buddy' folks for shamefully misleading an elderly woman.  I do love Amazon and my own Echo, but I'm wondering if Amazon has any fault here.  Surely I cannot be the only customer with this issue.  I think they should advertise ahead of time that you must pay a fee every three months for the service.  Why hide this fact?  Give people a choice before they shell out money for the Echo.  Just seems shady and I don't like it at all. Also of note, the Ask My Buddy website (wwwaskmybuddy.net) has no mention of a fee anywhere on the page. As a matter of fact, it falsely states that ""Ask My Buddy is a free service that leverages Amazon’s Alexa Voice Platform to connect a user to their Personal Alert ⨁ Network using only their voice. The service is designed for ease of use by all customers, and is a favorite of senior and mobility challenged individuals. Ask My Buddy is not a substitute for 911, but rather an additional tool for those trying to preserve their independence, offering the security of knowing help is just a shout away"".LIES LIES LIES.  All lies and false advertising!  Buyer beware.",2016-12-10,41ad66bc-a6d5-4766-8323-e05f903549b9,1.0,Ask My Buddy,1503628036.24348,I'd give it -5 if I could.,38

The  alert instructs the recipient to check up on the sender (Alexa user). Ideal for an infirm person who might need to summon help - e.g., after a fall. My live-alone, infirm brother has two Echos and can summon help from nearby relatives from anywhere in his home.

Zombie Fan,2,"I have Multiple Sclerosis so I was very excited to add this app. I added my contacts and tested it out and it worked. My biggest issue with Alexa is that there are trigger words for apps. When I ordered Alexa with the hopes of it having abilities added like this, I had no idea I would have to remember trigger words for added capabilities especially in an emergency. Unless I practice these trigger words on a regular basis, I highly doubt I will remember them when needed the most. I keep trying to associate saying ""Alexa ask my buddy..."" with this emergency. Why is it not ""Alexa I've fallen and I can't get up..."" Or at least ""Alexa I have an emergency...""The site does have where you can print out these trigger words and put them in places that you might fall.  I find that idea ridiculous that it's needed in the first place.

When the voicemail picks up AMB begins speaking then when you go back later to check who called all you will receive is a noise.  Many people do not pick up unknown callers.

T DeMon Spencer,0,I've been looking for something exactly like this since I purchased my first Alexa.  It does everything it says it does and works seamlessly with no hiccups or issues at all.  I get my messages read to me. I send text messages without having to touch my phone.  I have 3 Alexa units throughout my house so the intercom feature comes in very handy. I didn't know I needed it until I downloaded Mastermind and found it by mistake.  I can even make phone calls with my cell phone upstairs charging while I'm downstairs cooking.I'm sure I'll be using this app more than any other on my phone.  So give it a try.

Kasper,2,"Im changing my 3 star to a five star rating and here is why? After posting my review around 12 hours later i git an email from Nik the man behind Mastermind. He told me that after reading about the ussues i was having with my phone, he and his team spent all day trying to figure out the fixes. He explained the type of phone I havethe Galaxy Note 4 a 3 year old phone might not be able to use some of the features, how ever after a long day of trouble shooting he gave me clear and simple instructions on what I needed to do which included the app update that included the fixes for my phone. He did say do to the phone type the answering the phone access might not work. So i did as instructed and BAM all but the 1 feature as he said worked. I can live without that 1 feature. He did say if I upgraded my phone to a newer version, that I would be able to have ALL features working. Well I love my phone so I'll settle with the no answering part. Everything else works amazingly. I'll leave my first review up so you can get the idea. 5 star for app, 5 STAR FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Thank you Nik for going out of your way to make a customer happy.  (Original review paid the $15.00 to not have to wait. I've been trying this out for over 2 hours. I have the amazon echo, my phone is the samsung galaxy note 4. I've tried all the features out. Most of them work and some do not. I'm disappointed that there is some that doesn't work since I paid not to wait. Here is what is not working. Send call to voicemail when I have a incoming call. Ring my phone doesn't ring my phone, accept an incoming call that doesn't work. Get notification's it says I don't have any when I do, when I listen to my status update it does not tell me I missed a call as it shows in your video. It does everything else perfectly so I'm half happy I'd give this 5 stars if I was able to have everything working since I paid 15 bucks not to wait. Any help would be great. I did disable the skill and re-enabled it, also I removed the app and reinstalled it to my phone to see if that would help and it did not. Like I said everything else works great but I'd like it all to work please. What do I do?)",2017-01-21,3048302c-00dc-430f-b49e-ed3265a27bcf,5.0,Mastermind - SMS Text Messaging & Phone Calls,1503628258.3338401,Changed to 5 stars I'll explain why,14
Leander Carey,0,"Brilliant idea. The Android app itself is solid, works well, and has so far been completely free of bugs. The signup process is a bit complex but being a closed beta that's understandable. As far as the service & Alexa app are concerned, it works pretty well. There are little kinks here & there but far fewer than you would expect and they are quick to update to fix things, incorporate new features, refine current features, & take customer feedback extremely seriously & effectively. A few more iterations of the up, updates, & time to expand and it will be not only a solid five star app but perhaps the one killer app for the Echo there is.

April A.,0,"Best app Alexa has to offer!!  Send text messages, call people, check your phone status, notifications and so much more!  All you have to do is say, ""Alexa, ask Mastermind..."" and wahlah!  Mastermind calls it, sends it, reads it and does it all without the need to pick up your phone.  Your not limited to just people who have the app, everyone in your phones contact list is good to go!  It functions perfectly and has no connection issues and messages are processed immediately.

Chuck E,0,"Giving it 5 for potential. Absolutely tremendous help for those with limited mobility. Send and receive texts, check notifications, chromecast, check diary, and much more, just by asking Alexa/Echo to 'Ask Mastermind...' The biggest hurdle at the moment is Alexa's weak voice recognition and AI skills, but the developers can't be blamed for that.

Beth,0,I am moving back to an android phone after being on iPhone far too long. I know this app is coming to iPhone towards end of this year.  I am super excited about this App and it’s functionality and it will be one of the top 5 1st apps I download when the phone arrives in the next day or two. I’ve had the skill enabled on Alexa for almost a month since I found out about it and have watched several YouTube videos. Don’t give up too quickly. Be patient when using and learning about this or any app. It takes some time to learn the Alexa commands. The end result makes your screen time dwindle and that’s a huge plus.,2017-07-16,4c0e48eb-2a2c-4686-ad03-9477018d1ac3,4.0,Mastermind - SMS Text Messaging & Phone Calls,1503628264.628348,Be more productive and have less screen time,4

Afterbyrner,0,"I think many reviewers have made the mistake of complaining about Blue Link and/or the pricing offered by Hyundai when rating this skill.  This is a review of the actual Alexa skill, separate from what Hyundai may or may not charge.First, this is a great start.  Hyundai is one of the only car companies offering this kind of flexibility so I have to give them credit for being at the cutting edge of blending virtual assistants for the home with cars.  This skill comes in handy from time to time and it definitely gives you that ""wow I'm in the future"" feeling when you simply ask your virtual assistant to start your car while you're still pulling your pants on.  I also have to say that many other companies can learn from this skill, as it's one of the only ones I've used that allows me to issue two commands at once (ie ""Start my Sonata and set the heat to 72 degrees), or just one command (ie ""Start my Sonata"").In practice, though, I've found that more often than not it's easier to just unlock my phone and start the car with the Blue Link app.  The problem here is that issuing the ""Ask blue link to start my sonata..."" command virtually never works.  It's not just me, everyone in the house has struggled with it.  The only consistent way I can get it to work is to ask Alexa to open Blue Link, listen to the lengthy ""welcome to blue link"" schpeal and then say ""Start my Sonata...""  And if that command fails, I still have to listen to yet another lengthy blurb about incorrect commands before trying again.  It would actually be quicker to run outside and just start the car.Speaking of speed, this is sloooooooooowwwww.  I can issue the command to start the car, walk casually downstairs, put my shoes and coat on, wait for the garage door to open and walk out to the driveway before the car starts.  That's not an exaggeration, that's my daily routine.  A major part of this is that Blue Link itself is maddeningly slow, but relaying it through Alexa adds more time to the already slow process.Overall, the skill itself is a great step in the right direction, but it needs to do better at recognizing commands, and Hyundai needs to speed up the process.",2016-12-20,26f13d71-8a16-46a0-b0b0-49ee825eb0f8,3.0,Hyundai Blue Link,1503628452.384568,"A great thought, slow to execute, misses a lot of commands",18
Joshua Johnston,0,"This is a good skill that appears to work pretty easily, but there are definitely things that could be added.  I should be able to set the temperature in the car after remote start, and not only in the same command that starts it.  Blue Link's GPS location feature is also rather poor in general, but being able to ask the car where it was would be a welcome addition as well. Blue Link in general has actually only recently started to be reliable, and I hope it continues to improve.

JetRocket11,0,"Works very well. I have used it to start the car without any issues. I am giving it 3 stars because there is room for improvement. There is a caution about using it in private setting.

Starting with the 2015 Sonata/Genesis Hyundai introduced AVN 4.0/4.5 (do a search) which includes additional h/w supported functionality over their earlier nav/media systems.  It's that functionality that allows newer cars to be used with Alexa.  There will never be an update for older cars as the changes are h/w not s/w.  So either buy a newer Hyundai or don't buy an Echo if its primary purpose would be to control your car. I traded a 2014 Elantra GT for a 2016 specifically for the updated Nav capabilities which also include Android Auto and Apple Car Play.  For the record owners of older Hyundais won't be getting those features either for the same reason they can't use Alexa.

Christopher Dittmann,0,"Of course, I can't speak for Alexa's accuracy in all languages included in this skill.  Just French, Spanish, Italian, and basic very basic Russian and Norwegian.  She gets high marks from me in all of these.  If you are preparing to entertain a new friend or client who is not a native English speaker, this skill can help you learn a few basic phrases to help set your guest at ease and demonstrate your own openness and desire to at least try to cross the language bridge.  In that respect, you'd be surprised how little efforts on your part can yield such large results in establishing rapport and understanding.  Seen in this light, this unique and capable skill is a real boon.That's just one way I intend to use this skill.  I'm sure others will occur to me by and by.  It would be great if it went the other way, foreign-to-English, but that's very much more of a complex endeavor.Which leads me to comment on some of the negative reviews this skill has received.  To those reviewers, I ask, what were you expecting?  Berlitz in a box?  Alexa is a user-programmable device (read ""savvy user"" here), not a steel-plated United Nations employee.  Perhaps I should ask what some of these reviewers were smoking?In every way, this skill demonstrates some of the best things that can be done with the Alexa Skills Kit, the toolbox you use to develop skills, and it's clear from the user reviews of other skills in this category that Translated is out ahead of the pack.  The developer, and the skill, deserve a ""bravo"" for a job well done.  Magnifique!P.S.  I am not an employee of Amazon, nor associated in any way with the developer of this skill.",2017-03-26,f539bf8f-a8f8-42cc-bf81-e1e2ac2c3052,5.0,Translated,1503628511.0819998,Very useful and accurate.,10

I rarely order the same thing twice in a row, so it would be nice to have some variety.(Original Post - 1star)Says I have an invalid payment method.

I redid the entire account on both Alexa and on Domino's. From there website with all the same info I can order without any issues, but from Alexa I still get a generic ""invalid Payment Error"". It doesn't explain what is wrong with my account, and calling customer service from Dominoes, they couldn't see anything wrong either.Now, payment issue aside, Alexa hears the commands without issue and attempts to order my pre-saved order that I set on Dominoes Website, but I guess I've got to get off the couch and login to the computer and order the pizza the not so old-fashion way.

hma95,4,"We recently bought 3 amazon dots, one in the living room, bedroom and kitchen.  I read about both this skill and the my chef skill and started with what I though would be better was My Chef.  I have prime and have my husband under my prime account, so essentially we have 2 amazon accounts.  We would have to ask Alexa what account is this and since my husband does most of the grocery shopping, would have to first change to his account so the items would be put into My Chef shopping list.  Well sometimes he forgot and the items he said would go into my AMAZON list.  Then if the item was more than one word it would list it as separate item, like ""garlic sausage"" it would put on the list garlic and then another item sausage.  So it wasn't working out for us.  Then I installed OurGroceries, LOVE IT!!  You can ""link"" accounts so that no matter what amazon account you are on, when you say ""Alexa, ask our groceries to add garlic sausage to shopping list"" it adds it as ONE item to the list and it adds it automatically to BOTH our lists and is always syncing with each other.  The best thing, when he goes shopping and crosses items off the list, since the list is synced on our phones, it takes them off the list on my phone app as well!!  Have had NO problems with it so far and it was exactly what we were looking for!!

Tony L,1,"I tried darn near every list app there and they all fell way short until I found Our Groceries. First, it works across all my platforms, Android phone, 2 generations of Kindle/Fire, and on my PC in a web browser. Second, I can create all the different lists I want and name them as I want. Next, I can pick different sort orders for the things that are on the ""Buy"" list and the things I have ""Crossed-off"" my list. The Crossed-off list I keep in alphabetic order to make it easy to find things. For all my actual grocery items I have assigned the aisle in the store as the category. So i sort the Buy list, by category and all my list is in the order I find them in the store. I check-off (long press) each item as I grab it. They item goes to the Crossed-off list for next time and my Buy List scrolls up. Perfect and simple!When this became a skill for my Echo I was thrilled, but there were a few problems at first. First problem, my echo was not always understanding ""ask Our Groceries..."". I looked at the Alexa app when it failed and found it was interpreting ""our"" as ""are"". So now I just say ""ask R Groceries..."" and it works great. (It must be my mid-west accent...)Second, when I would ask it to add something to one of my lists that was already on my Crossed-off list, it would create a new item (uncategorized). I contacted Our Groceries support and it turned out to be a issue that it was not recognizing capitals and lower-case as the same. They fixed it and I am a happy camper.While I am in the kitchen cooking and I discover I am running low or out of an item, I simply call out ""Echo, ask R Groceries to add butter to the Grocery List"". So nice not having to remember to put it on the list later or having to wipe off my hand to do it immediately.I have lots of list that aren't even related to shopping. For example, my Library list has 2 items - ""Pick up materials"" and ""Return materials"". When I get an email notice from the library I have something to pick up, I call out, ""Echo, ask R Groceries to add Pick Up Materials to the Library List"". Then when I look over Our Groceries' list of Lists (a daily habit now), I see the count is 1 and I am reminded I need to go to the library. I can do the same for my RedBox videos too. Very handy!I don't know why so many people gave reviews saying it didn't work for them, but I suspect the problem was not with the skill itself.",2016-07-28,e396e546-2767-4f19-abf1-d285e3fd55a6,5.0,OurGroceries,1503628821.7600784,The BEST out there by far!,74

Categorizing things in lists can be extremely helpful as usually when grocery shopping foods, household goods, etc are all in the same categorical area.This product has other features such as barcode by a particuar product that I'm not sure of the value of right now.This product has nice possibiliities, it will be interesting to see how user friendly it is in real life application.",2017-06-13,462d36aa-995f-43c1-b012-c9952378311b,4.0,OurGroceries,1503628821.864179,Has Possibility,7
Amazon Customer,0,"Ever since I started keeping my grocery list on my phone I've longed for a way to quickly add items to the list by talking to my phone. This Alexa skill lets me do exactly that at exactly the time I need it: when I'm in the middle of prepping a meal. Now, with my Dot near the kitchen, when I'm making breakfast and am close to using up all our eggs, I simply say: ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add eggs,"" and eggs automatically shows up on my default OurGroceries list. If it's something we get from another store (for which I've set up a list), I just as the name of the store. So, if we're running low in paper towels, ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add paper towels to Costco"" does exactly what I've asked and paper towels is added to my Costco list in OurGroceries.

There's a few things the app itself is lacking, but as an add on for it I love it.Some useful commands:Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add <item> to <list name>Alexa, ask OurGroceries to remove <item> from <list name>Alexa, ask OurGroceries what's on the <list name>Alexa, ask OurGroceries if I have <item> on a listFeature request:ability to move items between lists - move <item> from <current list> to <new list>",2017-01-05,9aa3e33f-f20e-416b-b294-22f3242bef6e,5.0,OurGroceries,1503628833.9471269,Excellent add on if you already use for lists (especially shared),3

This app only has a single sort. The interface is not very appealing either. It has all the items that I have purchased in a crossed out list at the bottom. I could delete them, but then I have to add back the aisle category every time I add it to the list. My other app stores the item in invisibly until I need it again.

Kai,0,"Already being a user of OurGroceries via the Android app as well as the web app, I was ecstatic (seriously - I think I may even have let out a little yelp of joy) to see it had Alexa integration.After getting it setup, I've had no instances of it not working exactly as it should, and adding an item to the list I define.  Something that I think should be made clearer in the description of the skill is that ""Shopping List"" as noted in the example commands means a list that already exists that you've named ""Shopping List"".  If you don't use ""Shopping List"", it can be whatever pre-existing list you've created in the app.Personally, I use OurGroceries for all of my lists (not just groceries), so I have a minor issue that's specific to my usage outside of Alexa - My primary ""Groceries"" shopping list is named ""A2-Groceries"" to ensure that it's near the top of my lists while keeping the rest alphabetical.  While I haven't tried asking the Alexa skill to add directly to that list, I have instead added a new list in the app called ""Shopping list"", which is specifically for Alexa added things so that I can say ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add cereal to shopping list"" as it's easier to remember.",2017-01-19,93f80f50-6eb3-4175-9591-20dda5b803c6,4.0,OurGroceries,1503628876.0584679,Great - works exactly as expected.,2

Kelly Ness,0,"I like this skill. Reminds me of the text based MUDs and adventure games from my college days. I think it's frustrating that once you get on a certain path or sequence in most of the adventure you can't go back to the last ""room"" or area. Often you have to finish the mini adventure before you get an option to just go back to the starting area and go from there. Another frustrating thing is there are often multiple choices for movement or actions but choosing differently only adds steps to the adventure instead of changing the outcome or location you end up on. Other than these things, which could be easily improved, I've had a great time exploring this game and hope more areas and adventures are added in the future.

I was a little bummed the bronze key is no longer needed ( I did find it). I like games that make you unlock things to progress. It also helps someone who just starts to steer them in the right direction so they done get stuck in an area that they don't have equipment or haven't figured out how the game works (i.e. do actions that Alexa doesn't list) Great puzzles and great game can't wait to the next part of the journey goes live.",2017-01-07,68313077-e433-41ba-844b-bfa94fa6b6b0,5.0,The Magic Door,1503629060.5624378,Fun stories with different difficulty levels,5

Mel,0,"Tried this out with my 7 year old son.. it's a good start, but could definitely be better:The first choice allows you to pick from 3 paths. After that, most of the choices aren't really choices that move the story forward - mostly just keep going or go back. Later on you get more choices, but these just give you more information about the scenery and you can basically eventually choose all options. Sometimes she asks you what you want to do without giving you options - we found that if this happens you can say ""what are my choices?"" and she'll tell you.Having Alexa tell a story - especially a story - is a bit boring since there is no emotion to her voice. They do have some sound clips to add to it, but would be better if they recorded this with a voice with inflection and feeling.Basically it was a really long not overly interesting ""adventure"" that we didn't even finish because she randomly turned herself off.I might try a different path on a different day to see if it's any more interesting, but so far I'm not impressed.",2016-12-26,73a1bd38-82eb-4971-883f-6a80ca3db541,3.0,The Magic Door,1503629150.2133682,meh,6

PATOLA,0,"This will be a great concept once it is expanded upon. As of now it's lacking a bit.Specific examples:1. Alexa just speaks - she doesn't tell a story. For example Alexa says ""Bur"" instead saying saying ""Burrrr"" with any emotion. The good thing is the characters encountered during the story speak in a very animated way.2. When choosing an option we got stuck in a circle and had to choose a different option to get out of the circle.3.

Will,0,Needs some work. The Portal to the Gods is completely broken. Paths jump back and forth and then you just get kicked to the Magic Door. Attempting open the chest jumps to somethjng about an apple with key then anything you do there goes back to the Door. Many commands result in Alexa just saying goodbye and closing the skill. When a path works its great but for the most part it's just a jumble of bugs and frustration.,2016-07-04,061a072c-6936-489c-8165-b182f1e1a9be,2.0,The Magic Door,1503629270.136503,Needs a lot of work.

Ollie Allen,0,My family was really enjoying this game until it became absolutely incredibly frustrating. Specifically when we got to the Cloud Tower we opened a door to a closed room on a flight of stairs it was a bedroom there's a piece of mirror under a rug when you tell Alexa to pick up the piece of mirror she says there's no mirror in this room we found this problem repeats itself over and over and over and over and over and over and over again in the game you give Alexa simple instructions that she's already told you exist and she doesn't get it everything needs to be said in a very specific very particular Manner and sometimes she doesn't say it in the storyboard in the correct manner for you to repeat it to her so you can't just repeat what she says back at her and sometimes you have to repeat exactly what she says right back at her butt is confusing frustrating and I'm fun to play,2017-02-19,02f83d45-03b3-441d-84a1-17106b5101f9,1.0,The Magic Door,1503629288.1102688,Needs a lot of work,5

Michael Sturrock,0,"The time I spent “through the magic door” were unquestionably the most wasteful eight minutes of my existence to date. This applet is a blatant a pitiable attempt to stuff features into the Amazon Echo which, unless you have a spare million pounds for a compatible voice-controlled toaster, is only useful for music (assuming you have Spotify).From the moment Alexa beckoned me through the “magic” door and the manufactured door-hinge squeak noise sounded, I was sceptical. Even Alexa has Any film or scenario to date that has included a manufactured door hinge squeak has lacked any originally or plot depth. At least Alexa’s robotic storytelling matched my levels of charisma.I can’t remember what happened shortly after entering the door, but soon enough I came “face to face” with a small detestable rabbit. The rabbit talked at some length about trivial and annoying things, which was made more annoying by the fact the rabbit informed us that we were late for the princess’ party (to which he also was going).I don’t know why he would continue to talk if he knew we were all going to be late.The Rabbit proposed that to get there quicker, we could “take our chances with the troll” who may lend us his horse. I thought this was an odd way to talk about someone who apparently had a large enough capacity for generosity to lend a complete stranger use of his horse. Upon engaging with the troll, it immediately began to violently pursue me. At this point, it became clear that the little cretinous rabbit knew all along that the troll was going to be uncooperative. When I think back to what the rabbit said, its tone of voice was clearly laced with a level of deceit and malice only possessed by the most evil woodland creatures.Luckily, the story can be ended by a firm yank of the power chord in the opposite direction of the amazon echo. I can only recommend this to people with the brain capacity of wood.

Alexandra,0,"This game is ok when it works but a lot of the time, it doesn't. Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about:1) Sometimes when you tell the game to repeat a clue, it will respond with ""please answer yes or no"" and then it will beep to tell you that you got the question wrong before you even answered.2) The game will sometimes tell you that your answer is wrong, even though it's actually correct (see the photo attached to this review -- it is a screenshot from my phone of the voice history for my Echo). You can see that I answered the question correctly, even verbatim, but the game still told me it was wrong. Please note that the ""category"" text in between what the game said is the correct answer and my answer was actually for the question afterwards.3) Sometimes, you cannot understand what the clue is asking for. This is due to a mixture of a lack of proper inflection from the Echo and very poorly worded clues.Honestly, this game is just another example of an app that was rushed into existence with very little quality control (and the fact that it has not gotten any better over time leads me to believe that it's not actively developed).Overall, it's fun to play here and there but it can be very frustrating when it doesn't work as expected (which is quite often).",2016-07-05,be5ba422-f00f-4df0-8844-6cc0a6d9ad9a,1.0,Jeopardy!,1503629330.875056,Very Poor App,29

Tim Brown,0,"It's OK; I play it while washing dishes or cooking.  I'd give it 5 stars but for the following. Much of the time, I cannot understand what Alexa's pronunciation. She asks a question about berries and my wife an I look at each other and say ""I thought she said 'bears'"".  Other times, again because we don't have the benefit of reading the question on a screen like in the TV show, we get confused by homonyms: ""Known for their Razrs, this company... made the first... in 1984"".  Yes motorola makes Razrs, but they do not make razors.  Alex Trebek (or my own eyes) would have somehow indicated that Razr is spelled differently, Alexa did not. I guessed ""Gillette"". Perhaps different wording should have been used to clarify.  The communication breakdown goes both ways; sometimes when you ask Alexa to repeat the question by saying ""repeat"" she tells you that is wrong.  So much for bears / berries.  Other times she misses the correct answer entirely: ""what is a camel?"".  ""No, sorry, that is incorrect.  The correct answer is 'what is a camel'"".

Just a few comments: Like  other reviewers reported, Alexa will sometimes say you are wrong when you've clearly given the right answer. This is extremely frustrating, I wonder if the Amazon techs are using this skill to aid improvements in voice recognition? Second, how are weekly stats compiled? Does it favor  the everyday player? I invariably score in the top 1% on a weekly basis, My daily scores more in the 5-20% range. Also, if there's a communication problem in the middle of the game and it restarts you can correct any wrong answers, I never do this but the opportunity is there,All in all a fun game.

Lotus flower mama,0,"As a mostly stay-at-home mom, it's often hard for me to get really motivated, so I just tried this for the first time and I think it's okay. It's not, by any means, a GREAT workout, but on the days where you just don't want to do ANYTHING significant, it's enough to get your blood pumping and motivate you to do more (even if ""more"" is just getting a little more energy to get more housecleaning done!!)! I've done a LOT of different exercising in my life (but am in a slump due to a HORRIBLE past year!), including weight training, different forms of cardio, and Jillian Michaels DVDs (EXCELLENT, if you have the  energy and motivation, which I just DON'T right now!), so this isn't terribly challenging (not even breathing heavily) BUT it DID get me to MOVE, so that's more than I FELT like doing, and that's good enough for now! I will say that you absolutely MUST have prior exercise experience to do this workout, or you won't understand all of the exercises mentioned and, more importantly, you won't understand the proper FORM to do them, and THAT could lead to either a lack of results (IF you plan on doing this at least DAILY, if not 2 or more times per day!) or injury!

But then it doesn't recognize, ""Alexa, ready"". (It does have some amusing responses to that.) Even if it did recognize it, the extended break would detract significantly from the workout. To be useful, the workout must critically proceed continuously from start to finish.

Mary,1,"The idea with the 7 Minute Workout is that you're supposed to push yourself and rest as little as possible between each exercise. The default for resting is usually 10 seconds. It is impossible to get a rest a short as 10 seconds with this skill. All the blathering and the need to tell it that you're ready means that the rest period is more like 15 seconds. Although that might not sound like much of a difference, it really makes the 7 Minute Workout skill a lot easier than it should be.",2017-07-26,fcf80fb4-261e-46bd-b216-f544c57898c3,3.0,7-Minute Workout,1503629829.9179401,Disappointed with this skill,1

Jennifer browning,0,"This app is alright. It should play music for the 25 second work out periods. I think is should also instruct you with,  ""begin"" or ""go"" to start a new workout not just silence and a faint sound of a timer. I don't like that it only gives you about 3 seconds to say you are ready between exercises before it goes into an explaination EVERY TIME telling you how to work the app. Sometimes I needed a couple more seconds to set up my chair again or 2 more seconds of breathing after high knees! I think the compliments and motivational words it gives periodically is funny. Restarting it between exersises if you take a break is kind of a pain.  This idea of this app is great for me because I can knock out a small workout while my kiddo takes a nap it just needs a few tweaks.

Summer Rain,0,"This is a great little morning warm up to get my blood flowing. I'm 24 and in moderate shape, though, so I would have liked longer duration for each exercise - three times as long would have been great. Options for duration/intensity would be nice so people of different ages and skill levels could use it. Also, I knew what all the exercises were but some people may not, so a short optional description would be helpful.

A. Sparrow,0,Its easy to get up for 7 minutes and move with this app!I love the compliments it gives after each excercise is done.I do wish that it wouldn't give a full explanation of how to use the app before every exercise - annoying- but it's not a big deal.If you want to hear music during your session just begin listening to what you want and ask Alexa to open your seven minute workout. The music will play in the background.I hope more exercise apps become available for Alexa !,2016-02-29,7467e74d-f87b-4af3-bb2e-102a7aae1146,4.0,7-Minute Workout,1503629848.129591,Yes!

James A Burgin,1,"I use an Echo Show. It shows simple pictures of the exercises but not until the timer starts. It would be more helpful if the picture showed before you started. There are only a handful of exercises so you will remember them quickly anyway. The ending bell needs to be louder, I can barely hear it. I think this is a qood, quick, routine to supplement your other workouts. I know you can repeat it but it woukd be nice if they had built in increments up to 30 minutes where each exercise got longer as you improved. I know it would not be the 7 minute workout any longer but I'm OK with that.
