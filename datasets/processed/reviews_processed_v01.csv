R. Seehoffer,1,"The skill itself isn't bad--in fact I used it for a couple months without issue. My concern is that the pin code necessary to access account information, pay bills, etc is stored as plain text in Alexa's voice history list, and can be read by anyone who looks. 99% of people are not going to know how to go on Amazon through their PC and clear that history, or scroll through hundreds of entries and delete it from the Alexa app. This to me pretty much negates the security aspect of requiring a pin, and so I removed the skill.",2017-01-10,257b162a-8190-4db8-9fcc-b5fbdaa5e365,3.0,Capital One,1503627770.8015912,"Not a bad skill, but access pin is readable by anyone, even months after the fact.",27

It's just a little bit slow right now, but I'm sure that will improve.We are really eager for this skill to develop even further, e.g. search for transaction by merchant name, transfer funds between accounts, send a check, etc.  But even in the meantime, this saves the need to login the old fashioned way for basic info!",2017-03-26,235d41e7-1a09-44a7-8770-0bccecfe37b5,4.0,Capital One,1503627776.937122,The Promise of Alexa Realized,6

I also like the idea of being able to make a credit card payment, however, if you have already met your minimum amount due for the month and won't allow you to make an additional payment, even though there's still a balance, therefore you will have to use your app or log into your account online.

Jeff S.,1,"Sometimes technologies can match up so well as to become nearly perfect solutions for some of the most challenging problems we face. Take the task of taking care of our elderly family and friends - Ask My Buddy steps up as one of those perfect solutions. It leverages Alexa's ""always on"" capabilities so that my blind 89-year-old father has the means to call out if his cell phone battery dies (which happened today), he falls or is otherwise in need of help at a time no one is around. This combination skill and service along with the voice-interface that Alexa provides gives my father freedom of movement and all of his family a greater sense of security.In fact, I think this company should be bought out by Amazon and incorporated into all Echo units by default since it offers such a vital service for anyone, not only the elderly, to send a quick message for help. It also isn't bad for Dot sales in that we are now buying 3 more Echo dots for various remote areas of the house to accommodate this skill's capabilites. Ask My Buddy rocks!",2016-12-28,57a85c23-9159-466a-ad94-fb137d69533e,5.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627869.264671,A Perfect Combination of Technologies offering Freedom of Movement and Peace of Mind,32
Angela McElvein,2,"I have mine set up for my mom who lives w me, so when I'm away from home she can activate if necessary.

Of course I knew she was fine sitting across the room from me. The kicker was that my husband out of town also called in not knowing it was a &quot;test/mistake&quot; and wanted to make sure everything was ok.

Brandon Slattery,2,"I'm giving 4 stars because I believe this may have pioneered an idea for Alexa that I'm all for- not only to be used as a life alert system, but for text messaging functionality in general.Although this doesn't fit a need for me specifically, I downloaded it interested in the functionality.  I enjoyed sending a text to my SO with a few words and adds a lot of novelty to the echo.That being said, I think the ask my buddy skill has been obsoleted with the integration of IFTTT.  I now set a trigger, I.E.- ""Alexa, trigger Send mom I love you text"" and IFTTT sends the text I pre-wrote to the number I define.  This is awesome...but I still want more.Using IFTTT, I've been able to send pre-written texts, and even call my own phone (find my phone) so the functionality is there.  How long until I can ask Alexa ""Call my secretary"" or ""send a text to Jim saying ""sorry brother, I'm gonna be a little late""  How long until I can use skype through alexa?These are the things we REALLY want.  The skill here may be obsoleted by triggers, but 4 stars for developing more useful applications than making fart sounds for this exciting technology.",2015-12-29,f72b673d-e7e6-4c4c-a4f3-13f686086327,4.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627869.375617,A step in the correct direction,84

Remlan,1,"Awesome app! I had one of the telephone boxes that require a sizable monthly service charges that continually increased in cost. That service took as long as five to ten minutes to respond, though it had no problem coming on (without using the cumbersome button necklaces or bracelets) in the middle of the night waking everyone just to be discovered to have been a case of a malfunction or accidently touching a button. The box hummedconstantly, lots of static and it ate electricity. I finally gave up and ended the service. NOW I have this. With two Echoes in my home I am always within voice range of Alexa! On a trial run, within 30 seconds, my hubby's cell phone rang with information that I needed help. I have him set as a voice answer on his cell phone and two others set to receive texts because that is what they use most often. Now everyone is happy because I can get immediate help.  If you can afford a small donation, they are pleased but if not, they only ask for a good review! As someone in poor health, I feel much safer than I did with the over priced box. This is a win win situation and it works VERY well! I am a retired nurse and highly recommend it for anyone with health problems who may not be able to reach a phone OR forgets to always wear that large button necklace or bracelet all the time. I feel better when alone and so do my loved ones. Highly recommended for anyone with health issues who may not be able to afford 40.00  or so, each month for something they may not ever use, or have access to. This is the best thing EVER!

F. R. Cox,1,This is such a wonderful service and quite a bargain when compared to the other Life Alert or Live Line type services.  I've found that these services charge you anywhere from $9.99 to $39.99 Per Month and do little more than Ask My Buddy does. I can attest to this because I paid one of them $39.99 per month for several years for my mom.  Bottom line is we want a service that if/when we fall we can call out and get some help from our friends or emergency services.  Ask My Buddy does this function very well through Alexa and is only asking $10 every 3 Months to help maintain their services.  It is well worth the money and I highly recommend!,2017-04-05,716dfa8b-6f22-4f88-a140-0ecf868f042d,5.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627875.7740278,One of Alexa's Best Skills!,11

Jude525,1,"I haven't had to use this in an emergency, but I have run a couple tests and the system has worked as hoped. Set up was incredibly easy.While it isn't a factor on the Alexa app, I have to say that the development team is excellent. After setting up on my Echo Dot I contacted the development team about using it on my PC and they were right there explaining what I had missed in the set up. They have followed up twice with me checking if I have questions on either device. You don't usually get service this good for paid apps!I have two conditions that make me prone to falls, but neither one is severe enough for my insurer to pay for a traditional emergency button. Although Ask My Buddy isn't the same as a  911 service, it does take some of the fear away from my being alone. Especially at night when I am tired and most afraid to fall.Finally, if like me, you can't afford the subscription service, consider making a one time donation to the team.

One thing I found a little confusing though is Ask MY Buddies ""Messages "" Page. I finally figured out these msgs arent for actual alerts but for scheduled TESTS.

Of course I let them all know ahead of time that I was doing a test.  I'm so impressed I'm going to buy an Echo for my mother.  The peace of mind of having this is priceless..  Thank you for such a wonderful App.  I honestly don't know why anyone wouldn't want this.

I was in alot of pain and couldn't get up. I remembered my Ask My Buddy skill, and I'm sure glad I did! I asked to call my Daughter and she was able to get to me and help. Turns out I tore my MCL and my knee just wouldn't let me get up. This skill is awesome and accurate. It's also not just for the elderly.

nancy,1,Awesome skill!! My husband has had some health problems in the last few years. Electronics and computers frustrate him. Echo allows him to give voice commands and this skill allows him to alert me at work if something is wrong. I told my sister because she works in an assisted living setting. She said this will be a great recommendation for the residents there. They are sometimes given an alert for their neck but it alerts the facility only and due to liability issues they can not help them if they fall. How nice it will be for them to alert their son or daughter to come help them?!?,2017-01-15,6da2fbd0-9937-4d32-a13b-29cfa7b28b5e,5.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627907.6319108,Recommend to everyone I see!,3
Meghan,1,"I have 4 year old children who my mother watches during the day at my house. We don't have a home phone and if something were to happen to my mom, my girls might not be able to find her phone and make a call in an emergency. Ideally if there was a life and death emergency, they would call 911, but I am not sure 4yos are a good judge of that and I am just as happy that they can use the app to alert an adult in our family and let us triage the situation if the adult with this isn't able to help. We have tested this a couple of times with them and it has worked well. Thank you so much for the direction and reminder pages on your site. It has all the information about how to use the app and I put them on the front of my fridge and next to Alexa so my kids could reference them in an emergency. The Alexa UI is such that for apps you have to use a somewhat unnatural phrase, but with the reminder cards, you have a better chance of remembering it. I think it is also important to practice this skill (having first warned any alert contacts) and keep the relevant phrases in your mind.I can see that this could have a huge impact for elderly people that want independence, but also might need to call for help verbally. This is a great idea and while I hope I never have to REALLY use it, it gives me some peace of mind that it is there if we need it.",2016-12-30,01e69bd0-a9a2-4e7f-99b8-65ed553a217d,4.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627907.668663,Could Really Help in an Ermergency,9

Widgeon,1,I have several serious illnesses that place me at risk for falling and other medical emergencies. Having Alexa with the Ask My Buddy app that allows me to simply say Alexa ask my buddy and then name one or all and have a text or phone call sent immediately  saying I need help is more security than I ever thought I would have.  As of yet I have not had to use it but I have tested it with family and friends and it works. It brings a sense of security when I am home alone.  This would be great for parents that have teenagers at home that might need  to contact a parent in an emergency or anyone else. It is an amazing app that sends for help when you need it .

This was by far the best customer service I have ever received.. Thanks to their persistence I got into Ask My Buddyand easily set up my Contact List. A good hint was put your own name and details on the and send yourself an alert to see how the system works. This is a non profit effort and I am impressed.

M. Richardson,1,This was one of the most important reasons I bought the echo dot.  I was so happy to have a far less expensive alternative to lifeline type products.  However I see from one of the reviews that this app will have a charge eventually.  I certainly hope that it isn't as expensive as the alternatives or I will be one unhappy customer.  I did have to contact customer service to set up the app as it kept refusing my sign in.  They responded very quickly and gave me a detailed list of instructions which did allow me access finally.  I really appreciated that! So only 4 not 5 stars because of the potential for an unknown charge in the future.,2016-10-23,cd7021e6-fc6c-43f6-b133-9a93c457d5a6,4.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627926.7822864,"Great service, but future charges??",6

jjaquinta,1,"This can send an alert or message to a list of people you give by e-mail, phone or text.Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. As with any skill using a linked account, this is a little tricky to negotiate. It took me a few times and some puzzlement to work it out. I was a little leery giving it several contact methods for many people. I looked at the terms and conditions but they were typically long and cryptic. There was no clear statement that I could easily see saying that my info was not being sold. I blanked out my information after reviewing, but there was no way to delete your account.Usefulness: 3 out of 5. If you are buying an echo for an elderly relative, there can be some advantage to this app. It works well for the ""I've fallen and can't get up"" scenario. But not so well for just about any other scenario. Maybe when there are more Alexa devices out there and you can use this from your smartphone or car, there will be more use.It's also great if you want to spam or harass someone.Novelty: 4 out of 5. There have been one or two calendar integration apps. But this is the first general alert one. I'm happy to see that it sends fixed messages, instead of attempting low quality free format text. As a sender of canned messages go, this could be useful for a variety of things. Say if the web end could be connected up to IFTTT.Overall: 2 out of 5. I cannot, in good conscience, give this a rating based solely on quality. Up until a few months ago I was an Ethical Hacker, and got a very firm schooling in security and privacy. You can use this skill to set up several contacts with a variety of contact methods and then effortlessly blast out a message to them as often as you like. There is no opt-in. The only way the sender is identified is how they choose to be identified. There's no way, as a recipient, to stop the messages. Sure, if used as intended, it is beneficial. But there is huge potential with this for harassment and abuse.",2015-12-04,20dc8d9e-db63-425d-84b1-4bbc1c5c99b3,2.0,Ask My Buddy,1503627958.907943,"Mildly useful, but very open for abuse",10

The basic service will let you notify close family/friends in an emergency, and that's all most folks really need. Let the family members and friends you list as emergency contacts know that you've put them down to receive a text or voice call if you have an emergency.

Amazon Customer,1,"First, let me begin by saying that this app has been tested and works super fast for the contacts you set up. Second, for anyone who lives alone, with a disability of any kind, the elderly, and anyone who may have even undergone recent surgery and are needing that extra piece of mind for themselves and for their loved ones..install this!! There are bound to be times where you are not able to reach a cellphone or a security system button, but are still able to rely on Alexa to contact your Buddy app Contacts and this is the reason for such an important skill. I tested with all my contacts, I'm young and I had a fall a few months ago and had I had the My Buddy as a back up, it would have saved me a painful crawl to reach my cell. I cannot thank the team of experts enough for offering this skill with the Amazon echo devices. We surely hope not to have to use this, but thank you so much for offering this service so that when we do need it..we have it!!

Matt G,1,While it seems to work these things are frustrating:1. Maybe let people try the app first before asking them to commit funds.2. Once skill is enabled and you are taken tot the set up page there is no direct way through the skill on an iPhone to get back to the login page. The link can't even be copied in the skill description.

Bazinga,5,"FYI, for any potential users:  This app might be free, but you must pay for the ""Ask My Buddy"" service, which you don't find out about until AFTER you create an account. Extremely unhappy.  My elderly mother bought an Echo just for this service, and was led to believe it was free and it is not free.  The info, as we were in the process of signing her up, stated that if she couldn't afford to pay, that she could sign up for free, however there was absolutely no way possible to do this.  The fine print then goes on to reveal that they are a volunteer-based service and please be 'kind'.  They also discourage leaving bad reviews!  I'm sorry, but I think others should know about this false advertising. If I can help one person from buying an Echo just for this service (by being misled) then my time was worth it.  My anger here lies with the 'Ask My Buddy' folks for shamefully misleading an elderly woman.  I do love Amazon and my own Echo, but I'm wondering if Amazon has any fault here.  Surely I cannot be the only customer with this issue.  I think they should advertise ahead of time that you must pay a fee every three months for the service.  Why hide this fact?  Give people a choice before they shell out money for the Echo.  Just seems shady and I don't like it at all. Also of note, the Ask My Buddy website (wwwaskmybuddy.net) has no mention of a fee anywhere on the page. As a matter of fact, it falsely states that ""Ask My Buddy is a free service that leverages Amazon’s Alexa Voice Platform to connect a user to their Personal Alert ⨁ Network using only their voice. The service is designed for ease of use by all customers, and is a favorite of senior and mobility challenged individuals. Ask My Buddy is not a substitute for 911, but rather an additional tool for those trying to preserve their independence, offering the security of knowing help is just a shout away"".LIES LIES LIES.  All lies and false advertising!  Buyer beware.",2016-12-10,41ad66bc-a6d5-4766-8323-e05f903549b9,1.0,Ask My Buddy,1503628036.24348,I'd give it -5 if I could.,38

The  alert instructs the recipient to check up on the sender (Alexa user). Ideal for an infirm person who might need to summon help - e.g., after a fall. My live-alone, infirm brother has two Echos and can summon help from nearby relatives from anywhere in his home.

Zombie Fan,2,"I have Multiple Sclerosis so I was very excited to add this app. I added my contacts and tested it out and it worked. My biggest issue with Alexa is that there are trigger words for apps. When I ordered Alexa with the hopes of it having abilities added like this, I had no idea I would have to remember trigger words for added capabilities especially in an emergency. Unless I practice these trigger words on a regular basis, I highly doubt I will remember them when needed the most. I keep trying to associate saying ""Alexa ask my buddy..."" with this emergency. Why is it not ""Alexa I've fallen and I can't get up..."" Or at least ""Alexa I have an emergency...""The site does have where you can print out these trigger words and put them in places that you might fall.  I find that idea ridiculous that it's needed in the first place.

When the voicemail picks up AMB begins speaking then when you go back later to check who called all you will receive is a noise.  Many people do not pick up unknown callers.

T DeMon Spencer,0,I've been looking for something exactly like this since I purchased my first Alexa.  It does everything it says it does and works seamlessly with no hiccups or issues at all.  I get my messages read to me. I send text messages without having to touch my phone.  I have 3 Alexa units throughout my house so the intercom feature comes in very handy. I didn't know I needed it until I downloaded Mastermind and found it by mistake.  I can even make phone calls with my cell phone upstairs charging while I'm downstairs cooking.I'm sure I'll be using this app more than any other on my phone.  So give it a try.

Kasper,2,"Im changing my 3 star to a five star rating and here is why? After posting my review around 12 hours later i git an email from Nik the man behind Mastermind. He told me that after reading about the ussues i was having with my phone, he and his team spent all day trying to figure out the fixes. He explained the type of phone I havethe Galaxy Note 4 a 3 year old phone might not be able to use some of the features, how ever after a long day of trouble shooting he gave me clear and simple instructions on what I needed to do which included the app update that included the fixes for my phone. He did say do to the phone type the answering the phone access might not work. So i did as instructed and BAM all but the 1 feature as he said worked. I can live without that 1 feature. He did say if I upgraded my phone to a newer version, that I would be able to have ALL features working. Well I love my phone so I'll settle with the no answering part. Everything else works amazingly. I'll leave my first review up so you can get the idea. 5 star for app, 5 STAR FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Thank you Nik for going out of your way to make a customer happy.  (Original review paid the $15.00 to not have to wait. I've been trying this out for over 2 hours. I have the amazon echo, my phone is the samsung galaxy note 4. I've tried all the features out. Most of them work and some do not. I'm disappointed that there is some that doesn't work since I paid not to wait. Here is what is not working. Send call to voicemail when I have a incoming call. Ring my phone doesn't ring my phone, accept an incoming call that doesn't work. Get notification's it says I don't have any when I do, when I listen to my status update it does not tell me I missed a call as it shows in your video. It does everything else perfectly so I'm half happy I'd give this 5 stars if I was able to have everything working since I paid 15 bucks not to wait. Any help would be great. I did disable the skill and re-enabled it, also I removed the app and reinstalled it to my phone to see if that would help and it did not. Like I said everything else works great but I'd like it all to work please. What do I do?)",2017-01-21,3048302c-00dc-430f-b49e-ed3265a27bcf,5.0,Mastermind - SMS Text Messaging & Phone Calls,1503628258.3338401,Changed to 5 stars I'll explain why,14
Leander Carey,0,"Brilliant idea. The Android app itself is solid, works well, and has so far been completely free of bugs. The signup process is a bit complex but being a closed beta that's understandable. As far as the service & Alexa app are concerned, it works pretty well. There are little kinks here & there but far fewer than you would expect and they are quick to update to fix things, incorporate new features, refine current features, & take customer feedback extremely seriously & effectively. A few more iterations of the up, updates, & time to expand and it will be not only a solid five star app but perhaps the one killer app for the Echo there is.

April A.,0,"Best app Alexa has to offer!!  Send text messages, call people, check your phone status, notifications and so much more!  All you have to do is say, ""Alexa, ask Mastermind..."" and wahlah!  Mastermind calls it, sends it, reads it and does it all without the need to pick up your phone.  Your not limited to just people who have the app, everyone in your phones contact list is good to go!  It functions perfectly and has no connection issues and messages are processed immediately.

Chuck E,0,"Giving it 5 for potential. Absolutely tremendous help for those with limited mobility. Send and receive texts, check notifications, chromecast, check diary, and much more, just by asking Alexa/Echo to 'Ask Mastermind...' The biggest hurdle at the moment is Alexa's weak voice recognition and AI skills, but the developers can't be blamed for that.

Beth,0,I am moving back to an android phone after being on iPhone far too long. I know this app is coming to iPhone towards end of this year.  I am super excited about this App and it’s functionality and it will be one of the top 5 1st apps I download when the phone arrives in the next day or two. I’ve had the skill enabled on Alexa for almost a month since I found out about it and have watched several YouTube videos. Don’t give up too quickly. Be patient when using and learning about this or any app. It takes some time to learn the Alexa commands. The end result makes your screen time dwindle and that’s a huge plus.,2017-07-16,4c0e48eb-2a2c-4686-ad03-9477018d1ac3,4.0,Mastermind - SMS Text Messaging & Phone Calls,1503628264.628348,Be more productive and have less screen time,4

Afterbyrner,0,"I think many reviewers have made the mistake of complaining about Blue Link and/or the pricing offered by Hyundai when rating this skill.  This is a review of the actual Alexa skill, separate from what Hyundai may or may not charge.First, this is a great start.  Hyundai is one of the only car companies offering this kind of flexibility so I have to give them credit for being at the cutting edge of blending virtual assistants for the home with cars.  This skill comes in handy from time to time and it definitely gives you that ""wow I'm in the future"" feeling when you simply ask your virtual assistant to start your car while you're still pulling your pants on.  I also have to say that many other companies can learn from this skill, as it's one of the only ones I've used that allows me to issue two commands at once (ie ""Start my Sonata and set the heat to 72 degrees), or just one command (ie ""Start my Sonata"").In practice, though, I've found that more often than not it's easier to just unlock my phone and start the car with the Blue Link app.  The problem here is that issuing the ""Ask blue link to start my sonata..."" command virtually never works.  It's not just me, everyone in the house has struggled with it.  The only consistent way I can get it to work is to ask Alexa to open Blue Link, listen to the lengthy ""welcome to blue link"" schpeal and then say ""Start my Sonata...""  And if that command fails, I still have to listen to yet another lengthy blurb about incorrect commands before trying again.  It would actually be quicker to run outside and just start the car.Speaking of speed, this is sloooooooooowwwww.  I can issue the command to start the car, walk casually downstairs, put my shoes and coat on, wait for the garage door to open and walk out to the driveway before the car starts.  That's not an exaggeration, that's my daily routine.  A major part of this is that Blue Link itself is maddeningly slow, but relaying it through Alexa adds more time to the already slow process.Overall, the skill itself is a great step in the right direction, but it needs to do better at recognizing commands, and Hyundai needs to speed up the process.",2016-12-20,26f13d71-8a16-46a0-b0b0-49ee825eb0f8,3.0,Hyundai Blue Link,1503628452.384568,"A great thought, slow to execute, misses a lot of commands",18
Joshua Johnston,0,"This is a good skill that appears to work pretty easily, but there are definitely things that could be added.  I should be able to set the temperature in the car after remote start, and not only in the same command that starts it.  Blue Link's GPS location feature is also rather poor in general, but being able to ask the car where it was would be a welcome addition as well. Blue Link in general has actually only recently started to be reliable, and I hope it continues to improve.

JetRocket11,0,"Works very well. I have used it to start the car without any issues. I am giving it 3 stars because there is room for improvement. There is a caution about using it in private setting.

Starting with the 2015 Sonata/Genesis Hyundai introduced AVN 4.0/4.5 (do a search) which includes additional h/w supported functionality over their earlier nav/media systems.  It's that functionality that allows newer cars to be used with Alexa.  There will never be an update for older cars as the changes are h/w not s/w.  So either buy a newer Hyundai or don't buy an Echo if its primary purpose would be to control your car. I traded a 2014 Elantra GT for a 2016 specifically for the updated Nav capabilities which also include Android Auto and Apple Car Play.  For the record owners of older Hyundais won't be getting those features either for the same reason they can't use Alexa.

Christopher Dittmann,0,"Of course, I can't speak for Alexa's accuracy in all languages included in this skill.  Just French, Spanish, Italian, and basic very basic Russian and Norwegian.  She gets high marks from me in all of these.  If you are preparing to entertain a new friend or client who is not a native English speaker, this skill can help you learn a few basic phrases to help set your guest at ease and demonstrate your own openness and desire to at least try to cross the language bridge.  In that respect, you'd be surprised how little efforts on your part can yield such large results in establishing rapport and understanding.  Seen in this light, this unique and capable skill is a real boon.That's just one way I intend to use this skill.  I'm sure others will occur to me by and by.  It would be great if it went the other way, foreign-to-English, but that's very much more of a complex endeavor.Which leads me to comment on some of the negative reviews this skill has received.  To those reviewers, I ask, what were you expecting?  Berlitz in a box?  Alexa is a user-programmable device (read ""savvy user"" here), not a steel-plated United Nations employee.  Perhaps I should ask what some of these reviewers were smoking?In every way, this skill demonstrates some of the best things that can be done with the Alexa Skills Kit, the toolbox you use to develop skills, and it's clear from the user reviews of other skills in this category that Translated is out ahead of the pack.  The developer, and the skill, deserve a ""bravo"" for a job well done.  Magnifique!P.S.  I am not an employee of Amazon, nor associated in any way with the developer of this skill.",2017-03-26,f539bf8f-a8f8-42cc-bf81-e1e2ac2c3052,5.0,Translated,1503628511.0819998,Very useful and accurate.,10

I rarely order the same thing twice in a row, so it would be nice to have some variety.(Original Post - 1star)Says I have an invalid payment method.

I redid the entire account on both Alexa and on Domino's. From there website with all the same info I can order without any issues, but from Alexa I still get a generic ""invalid Payment Error"". It doesn't explain what is wrong with my account, and calling customer service from Dominoes, they couldn't see anything wrong either.Now, payment issue aside, Alexa hears the commands without issue and attempts to order my pre-saved order that I set on Dominoes Website, but I guess I've got to get off the couch and login to the computer and order the pizza the not so old-fashion way.

hma95,4,"We recently bought 3 amazon dots, one in the living room, bedroom and kitchen.  I read about both this skill and the my chef skill and started with what I though would be better was My Chef.  I have prime and have my husband under my prime account, so essentially we have 2 amazon accounts.  We would have to ask Alexa what account is this and since my husband does most of the grocery shopping, would have to first change to his account so the items would be put into My Chef shopping list.  Well sometimes he forgot and the items he said would go into my AMAZON list.  Then if the item was more than one word it would list it as separate item, like ""garlic sausage"" it would put on the list garlic and then another item sausage.  So it wasn't working out for us.  Then I installed OurGroceries, LOVE IT!!  You can ""link"" accounts so that no matter what amazon account you are on, when you say ""Alexa, ask our groceries to add garlic sausage to shopping list"" it adds it as ONE item to the list and it adds it automatically to BOTH our lists and is always syncing with each other.  The best thing, when he goes shopping and crosses items off the list, since the list is synced on our phones, it takes them off the list on my phone app as well!!  Have had NO problems with it so far and it was exactly what we were looking for!!

Tony L,1,"I tried darn near every list app there and they all fell way short until I found Our Groceries. First, it works across all my platforms, Android phone, 2 generations of Kindle/Fire, and on my PC in a web browser. Second, I can create all the different lists I want and name them as I want. Next, I can pick different sort orders for the things that are on the ""Buy"" list and the things I have ""Crossed-off"" my list. The Crossed-off list I keep in alphabetic order to make it easy to find things. For all my actual grocery items I have assigned the aisle in the store as the category. So i sort the Buy list, by category and all my list is in the order I find them in the store. I check-off (long press) each item as I grab it. They item goes to the Crossed-off list for next time and my Buy List scrolls up. Perfect and simple!When this became a skill for my Echo I was thrilled, but there were a few problems at first. First problem, my echo was not always understanding ""ask Our Groceries..."". I looked at the Alexa app when it failed and found it was interpreting ""our"" as ""are"". So now I just say ""ask R Groceries..."" and it works great. (It must be my mid-west accent...)Second, when I would ask it to add something to one of my lists that was already on my Crossed-off list, it would create a new item (uncategorized). I contacted Our Groceries support and it turned out to be a issue that it was not recognizing capitals and lower-case as the same. They fixed it and I am a happy camper.While I am in the kitchen cooking and I discover I am running low or out of an item, I simply call out ""Echo, ask R Groceries to add butter to the Grocery List"". So nice not having to remember to put it on the list later or having to wipe off my hand to do it immediately.I have lots of list that aren't even related to shopping. For example, my Library list has 2 items - ""Pick up materials"" and ""Return materials"". When I get an email notice from the library I have something to pick up, I call out, ""Echo, ask R Groceries to add Pick Up Materials to the Library List"". Then when I look over Our Groceries' list of Lists (a daily habit now), I see the count is 1 and I am reminded I need to go to the library. I can do the same for my RedBox videos too. Very handy!I don't know why so many people gave reviews saying it didn't work for them, but I suspect the problem was not with the skill itself.",2016-07-28,e396e546-2767-4f19-abf1-d285e3fd55a6,5.0,OurGroceries,1503628821.7600784,The BEST out there by far!,74

Categorizing things in lists can be extremely helpful as usually when grocery shopping foods, household goods, etc are all in the same categorical area.This product has other features such as barcode by a particuar product that I'm not sure of the value of right now.This product has nice possibiliities, it will be interesting to see how user friendly it is in real life application.",2017-06-13,462d36aa-995f-43c1-b012-c9952378311b,4.0,OurGroceries,1503628821.864179,Has Possibility,7
Amazon Customer,0,"Ever since I started keeping my grocery list on my phone I've longed for a way to quickly add items to the list by talking to my phone. This Alexa skill lets me do exactly that at exactly the time I need it: when I'm in the middle of prepping a meal. Now, with my Dot near the kitchen, when I'm making breakfast and am close to using up all our eggs, I simply say: ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add eggs,"" and eggs automatically shows up on my default OurGroceries list. If it's something we get from another store (for which I've set up a list), I just as the name of the store. So, if we're running low in paper towels, ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add paper towels to Costco"" does exactly what I've asked and paper towels is added to my Costco list in OurGroceries.

There's a few things the app itself is lacking, but as an add on for it I love it.Some useful commands:Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add <item> to <list name>Alexa, ask OurGroceries to remove <item> from <list name>Alexa, ask OurGroceries what's on the <list name>Alexa, ask OurGroceries if I have <item> on a listFeature request:ability to move items between lists - move <item> from <current list> to <new list>",2017-01-05,9aa3e33f-f20e-416b-b294-22f3242bef6e,5.0,OurGroceries,1503628833.9471269,Excellent add on if you already use for lists (especially shared),3

This app only has a single sort. The interface is not very appealing either. It has all the items that I have purchased in a crossed out list at the bottom. I could delete them, but then I have to add back the aisle category every time I add it to the list. My other app stores the item in invisibly until I need it again.

Kai,0,"Already being a user of OurGroceries via the Android app as well as the web app, I was ecstatic (seriously - I think I may even have let out a little yelp of joy) to see it had Alexa integration.After getting it setup, I've had no instances of it not working exactly as it should, and adding an item to the list I define.  Something that I think should be made clearer in the description of the skill is that ""Shopping List"" as noted in the example commands means a list that already exists that you've named ""Shopping List"".  If you don't use ""Shopping List"", it can be whatever pre-existing list you've created in the app.Personally, I use OurGroceries for all of my lists (not just groceries), so I have a minor issue that's specific to my usage outside of Alexa - My primary ""Groceries"" shopping list is named ""A2-Groceries"" to ensure that it's near the top of my lists while keeping the rest alphabetical.  While I haven't tried asking the Alexa skill to add directly to that list, I have instead added a new list in the app called ""Shopping list"", which is specifically for Alexa added things so that I can say ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add cereal to shopping list"" as it's easier to remember.",2017-01-19,93f80f50-6eb3-4175-9591-20dda5b803c6,4.0,OurGroceries,1503628876.0584679,Great - works exactly as expected.,2

Kelly Ness,0,"I like this skill. Reminds me of the text based MUDs and adventure games from my college days. I think it's frustrating that once you get on a certain path or sequence in most of the adventure you can't go back to the last ""room"" or area. Often you have to finish the mini adventure before you get an option to just go back to the starting area and go from there. Another frustrating thing is there are often multiple choices for movement or actions but choosing differently only adds steps to the adventure instead of changing the outcome or location you end up on. Other than these things, which could be easily improved, I've had a great time exploring this game and hope more areas and adventures are added in the future.

It also helps someone who just starts to steer them in the right direction so they done get stuck in an area that they don't have equipment or haven't figured out how the game works (i.e. do actions that Alexa doesn't list) Great puzzles and great game can't wait to the next part of the journey goes live.",2017-01-07,68313077-e433-41ba-844b-bfa94fa6b6b0,5.0,The Magic Door,1503629060.5624378,Fun stories with different difficulty levels,5

Mel,0,"Tried this out with my 7 year old son.. it's a good start, but could definitely be better:The first choice allows you to pick from 3 paths. After that, most of the choices aren't really choices that move the story forward - mostly just keep going or go back. Later on you get more choices, but these just give you more information about the scenery and you can basically eventually choose all options. Sometimes she asks you what you want to do without giving you options - we found that if this happens you can say ""what are my choices?"" and she'll tell you.Having Alexa tell a story - especially a story - is a bit boring since there is no emotion to her voice. They do have some sound clips to add to it, but would be better if they recorded this with a voice with inflection and feeling.Basically it was a really long not overly interesting ""adventure"" that we didn't even finish because she randomly turned herself off.I might try a different path on a different day to see if it's any more interesting, but so far I'm not impressed.",2016-12-26,73a1bd38-82eb-4971-883f-6a80ca3db541,3.0,The Magic Door,1503629150.2133682,meh,6

PATOLA,0,"This will be a great concept once it is expanded upon. As of now it's lacking a bit.Specific examples:1. Alexa just speaks - she doesn't tell a story. For example Alexa says ""Bur"" instead saying saying ""Burrrr"" with any emotion. The good thing is the characters encountered during the story speak in a very animated way.2. When choosing an option we got stuck in a circle and had to choose a different option to get out of the circle.3.

Will,0,Needs some work. The Portal to the Gods is completely broken. Paths jump back and forth and then you just get kicked to the Magic Door. Attempting open the chest jumps to somethjng about an apple with key then anything you do there goes back to the Door. Many commands result in Alexa just saying goodbye and closing the skill. When a path works its great but for the most part it's just a jumble of bugs and frustration.,2016-07-04,061a072c-6936-489c-8165-b182f1e1a9be,2.0,The Magic Door,1503629270.136503,Needs a lot of work.

Ollie Allen,0,My family was really enjoying this game until it became absolutely incredibly frustrating. Specifically when we got to the Cloud Tower we opened a door to a closed room on a flight of stairs it was a bedroom there's a piece of mirror under a rug when you tell Alexa to pick up the piece of mirror she says there's no mirror in this room we found this problem repeats itself over and over and over and over and over and over and over again in the game you give Alexa simple instructions that she's already told you exist and she doesn't get it everything needs to be said in a very specific very particular Manner and sometimes she doesn't say it in the storyboard in the correct manner for you to repeat it to her so you can't just repeat what she says back at her and sometimes you have to repeat exactly what she says right back at her butt is confusing frustrating and I'm fun to play,2017-02-19,02f83d45-03b3-441d-84a1-17106b5101f9,1.0,The Magic Door,1503629288.1102688,Needs a lot of work,5

Michael Sturrock,0,"The time I spent “through the magic door” were unquestionably the most wasteful eight minutes of my existence to date. This applet is a blatant a pitiable attempt to stuff features into the Amazon Echo which, unless you have a spare million pounds for a compatible voice-controlled toaster, is only useful for music (assuming you have Spotify).From the moment Alexa beckoned me through the “magic” door and the manufactured door-hinge squeak noise sounded, I was sceptical. Even Alexa has Any film or scenario to date that has included a manufactured door hinge squeak has lacked any originally or plot depth. At least Alexa’s robotic storytelling matched my levels of charisma.I can’t remember what happened shortly after entering the door, but soon enough I came “face to face” with a small detestable rabbit. The rabbit talked at some length about trivial and annoying things, which was made more annoying by the fact the rabbit informed us that we were late for the princess’ party (to which he also was going).I don’t know why he would continue to talk if he knew we were all going to be late.The Rabbit proposed that to get there quicker, we could “take our chances with the troll” who may lend us his horse. I thought this was an odd way to talk about someone who apparently had a large enough capacity for generosity to lend a complete stranger use of his horse. Upon engaging with the troll, it immediately began to violently pursue me. At this point, it became clear that the little cretinous rabbit knew all along that the troll was going to be uncooperative. When I think back to what the rabbit said, its tone of voice was clearly laced with a level of deceit and malice only possessed by the most evil woodland creatures.Luckily, the story can be ended by a firm yank of the power chord in the opposite direction of the amazon echo. I can only recommend this to people with the brain capacity of wood.

Alexandra,0,"This game is ok when it works but a lot of the time, it doesn't. Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about:1) Sometimes when you tell the game to repeat a clue, it will respond with ""please answer yes or no"" and then it will beep to tell you that you got the question wrong before you even answered.2) The game will sometimes tell you that your answer is wrong, even though it's actually correct (see the photo attached to this review -- it is a screenshot from my phone of the voice history for my Echo). You can see that I answered the question correctly, even verbatim, but the game still told me it was wrong. Please note that the ""category"" text in between what the game said is the correct answer and my answer was actually for the question afterwards.3) Sometimes, you cannot understand what the clue is asking for. This is due to a mixture of a lack of proper inflection from the Echo and very poorly worded clues.Honestly, this game is just another example of an app that was rushed into existence with very little quality control (and the fact that it has not gotten any better over time leads me to believe that it's not actively developed).Overall, it's fun to play here and there but it can be very frustrating when it doesn't work as expected (which is quite often).",2016-07-05,be5ba422-f00f-4df0-8844-6cc0a6d9ad9a,1.0,Jeopardy!,1503629330.875056,Very Poor App,29

Tim Brown,0,"It's OK; I play it while washing dishes or cooking.  I'd give it 5 stars but for the following. Much of the time, I cannot understand what Alexa's pronunciation. She asks a question about berries and my wife an I look at each other and say ""I thought she said 'bears'"".  Other times, again because we don't have the benefit of reading the question on a screen like in the TV show, we get confused by homonyms: ""Known for their Razrs, this company... made the first... in 1984"".  Yes motorola makes Razrs, but they do not make razors.  Alex Trebek (or my own eyes) would have somehow indicated that Razr is spelled differently, Alexa did not. I guessed ""Gillette"". Perhaps different wording should have been used to clarify.  The communication breakdown goes both ways; sometimes when you ask Alexa to repeat the question by saying ""repeat"" she tells you that is wrong.  So much for bears / berries.  Other times she misses the correct answer entirely: ""what is a camel?"".  ""No, sorry, that is incorrect.  The correct answer is 'what is a camel'"".

Also, if you say ANYTHING other than ""repeat"" on the questions that you need to hear twice because a robot's inflection/pronunciation isn't always correct, it'll automatically count it wrong.

Just a few comments: Like  other reviewers reported, Alexa will sometimes say you are wrong when you've clearly given the right answer. This is extremely frustrating, I wonder if the Amazon techs are using this skill to aid improvements in voice recognition? Second, how are weekly stats compiled? Does it favor  the everyday player? I invariably score in the top 1% on a weekly basis, My daily scores more in the 5-20% range. Also, if there's a communication problem in the middle of the game and it restarts you can correct any wrong answers, I never do this but the opportunity is there,All in all a fun game.

Lotus flower mama,0,"As a mostly stay-at-home mom, it's often hard for me to get really motivated, so I just tried this for the first time and I think it's okay. It's not, by any means, a GREAT workout, but on the days where you just don't want to do ANYTHING significant, it's enough to get your blood pumping and motivate you to do more (even if ""more"" is just getting a little more energy to get more housecleaning done!!)! I've done a LOT of different exercising in my life (but am in a slump due to a HORRIBLE past year!), including weight training, different forms of cardio, and Jillian Michaels DVDs (EXCELLENT, if you have the  energy and motivation, which I just DON'T right now!), so this isn't terribly challenging (not even breathing heavily) BUT it DID get me to MOVE, so that's more than I FELT like doing, and that's good enough for now! I will say that you absolutely MUST have prior exercise experience to do this workout, or you won't understand all of the exercises mentioned and, more importantly, you won't understand the proper FORM to do them, and THAT could lead to either a lack of results (IF you plan on doing this at least DAILY, if not 2 or more times per day!) or injury!

But then it doesn't recognize, ""Alexa, ready"". (It does have some amusing responses to that.) Even if it did recognize it, the extended break would detract significantly from the workout. To be useful, the workout must critically proceed continuously from start to finish.

Mary,1,"The idea with the 7 Minute Workout is that you're supposed to push yourself and rest as little as possible between each exercise. The default for resting is usually 10 seconds. It is impossible to get a rest a short as 10 seconds with this skill. All the blathering and the need to tell it that you're ready means that the rest period is more like 15 seconds. Although that might not sound like much of a difference, it really makes the 7 Minute Workout skill a lot easier than it should be.",2017-07-26,fcf80fb4-261e-46bd-b216-f544c57898c3,3.0,7-Minute Workout,1503629829.9179401,Disappointed with this skill,1

Jennifer browning,0,"This app is alright. It should play music for the 25 second work out periods. I think is should also instruct you with,  ""begin"" or ""go"" to start a new workout not just silence and a faint sound of a timer. I don't like that it only gives you about 3 seconds to say you are ready between exercises before it goes into an explaination EVERY TIME telling you how to work the app. Sometimes I needed a couple more seconds to set up my chair again or 2 more seconds of breathing after high knees! I think the compliments and motivational words it gives periodically is funny. Restarting it between exersises if you take a break is kind of a pain.  This idea of this app is great for me because I can knock out a small workout while my kiddo takes a nap it just needs a few tweaks.

Summer Rain,0,"This is a great little morning warm up to get my blood flowing. I'm 24 and in moderate shape, though, so I would have liked longer duration for each exercise - three times as long would have been great. Options for duration/intensity would be nice so people of different ages and skill levels could use it. Also, I knew what all the exercises were but some people may not, so a short optional description would be helpful.

A. Sparrow,0,Its easy to get up for 7 minutes and move with this app!I love the compliments it gives after each excercise is done.I do wish that it wouldn't give a full explanation of how to use the app before every exercise - annoying- but it's not a big deal.If you want to hear music during your session just begin listening to what you want and ask Alexa to open your seven minute workout. The music will play in the background.I hope more exercise apps become available for Alexa !,2016-02-29,7467e74d-f87b-4af3-bb2e-102a7aae1146,4.0,7-Minute Workout,1503629848.129591,Yes!

James A Burgin,1,"I use an Echo Show. It shows simple pictures of the exercises but not until the timer starts. It would be more helpful if the picture showed before you started. There are only a handful of exercises so you will remember them quickly anyway. The ending bell needs to be louder, I can barely hear it. I think this is a qood, quick, routine to supplement your other workouts. I know you can repeat it but it woukd be nice if they had built in increments up to 30 minutes where each exercise got longer as you improved. I know it would not be the 7 minute workout any longer but I'm OK with that.

David in Dallas,0,"Hearing all the fuss about Fox News caused me to try them out for myself.  As a loyal ""CNN-ist"" for 20+ years, I didn't think I'd be impressed.  What I discovered was that Fox News really is the only NEWS organization left that presents both sides of any given position.I'm apolitical and just don't do politics. Unfortunately however, it seems CNN, NPR, and the TV networks' news divisions have all become political advocates, instead of journalists. If I desire advocacy, I can find any number of websites that suit any political point of view. I enjoy Fox News' NEWScasts however, because they present information about the world and give me the facts, without all the advocacy from the anchor.Of course they have commentary segments/shows, and all the commentators (different from anchors), on Fox News are conservatives.  During their actual NEWScasts however, it's refreshing to hear news anchors present NEWS to me in a balanced fashion, allowing me to take it for what it is (INFORMATION), without all the political spin or political advocacy that seems to have infiltrated all the other ""news"" organizations.  I think I've found a new news home.",2016-12-06,43569816-73c1-4737-a092-fbc5d0084c26,5.0,Fox News,1504378948.11208,New to Fox News... It Really IS Balanced,212

Ian D.,0,"Perfectly good for what it is and does what it's supposed to, but far from enjoying it, my cat feels threatened by it. He's a spoiled baby (thanks to me) and when his brother cat passed away recently, Keats became an only child and could not be happier about his newfound monopoly on my attention. So without thinking, I tried this app on him and I could see the tension in his face: the last thing he wants around here is another cat.So I'd just recommend thinking about your cat a little before exposing her or him to this skill, as it's very convincing and will make your kitty think there's another of the feline kind around.

Bob S.,0,"To those that are having any issues: I promise you this works as you would want and expect.  If you have any questions, they have great help at colortigerapps@gmail.com.  Just e-mail them.But here's a few tricks I've found.1:  Alexa wants to hear commands in a certain way.  The most important thing is to use the following syntax:""Alexa: Tell Anymote TO xxx MY yyy""Where xxx is the remote control button name, and yyy is the remote name.The words TO and MY are VERY important.2: Alexa is learning new words everyday.  But just as Alexa sometimes doesn't catch what you say just right under normal circumstances, the same can be true using this skill.  For example, I have an A/V switcher with buttons normally named A1..A2..A3..B1..B2 etc.  But Alexa doesn't understand those as words and will send Command ""undefined."" to the app.  But in the Anymote app. you can rename any button name - just click on the pencil edit icon for your remote, click on EDIT, highlight the button you want to rename, and click on tT (text) in the upper left.  This will show you the DEFAULT button name.  This is what you must use in your command to Alexa (""xxx"" in my first trick above) - but you can change it.  So in my example, change A1 to DVR and you  will see the command is translated and will work properly.*** When first starting out you should use the edit feature in the app. to see EXACTLY what the buttons names are, and say them to Alexa just as they are shown in my TIP # 1 above.3: Just because a command is translated and shows up on your smart device doesn't mean it will work unless the button name and remote name are translated exactly correct.  So Alexa will translate to your smart device Received voice command ""volume up"" for remote ""Television"" - but if your button is not named ""Volume UP"" it won't do anything.  Likewise if you don't have a remote named ""Television"".So in short, name your remote and button names (which you can change in the app.) with words Alexa will always translate properly and you will solve 99% of the issues.The really neat thing is the app doesn't have to be launched on your smart device.  If you have an Anymote Home (which I HIGHLY recommend, available on Amazon) IR blaster/recorder, just make sure bluetooth is turned on (you DO NOT need to connect bluetooth, that happens automatically).And make sure you have WIFI or a network connection to your Amazon Echo.With the well over 1,250,000 remote device configurations available in the app. and easy to match to your devices, and the record capability for just about any remote you have, you'll be able to control just about anything with Alexa voice commands with this skill.",2015-12-11,51dd3ad8-40f5-4ac6-8780-b77770bf9cfb,5.0,AnyMote Smart Remote,1504379868.783145,MUST READ TIPS FOR THE ANYMOTE SMART REMOTE SKILL,34

If you have an Anymote Home (which I HIGHLY recommend, available on Amazon) IR blaster/recorder, just make sure bluetooth is turned on (you DO NOT need to connect bluetooth, that happens automatically).And make sure you have WIFI or a network connection to your Amazon Echo.With the well over 1,250,000 remote device configurations available in the app. and easy to match to your devices, and the record capability for just about any remote you have, you'll be able to control just about anything with Alexa voice commands with this skill.",2016-01-02,f8cdcfae-c63e-4b31-ab30-fa8c46401625,3.0,AnyMote Smart Remote,1504379868.8061912,"The same post as below, but with HTML removed for easier viewing!",9
robert evans,0,"Started setting up remotes on my iphone 6s using anymote app.  The cable and sound bar worked, but it couldn't find the right remote for my smart TV. I had to use a generic one.  After setting up remotes, I notice that after exiting the anymote app and going back in to use the remotes, there are connection issues between anymote and my phone.  I would go into view bluetooth devices on my phone and anymote would not be there.  It seems to do this about 85% of the time.  Programming of buttons using the record method also does not work. My phone kept loosing connection to anymote and when I finally was able to connect, pointing the tv remote at anymote and pressing the command I want to program often did nothing.  If I finally get it to take the command, it does not work when trying to use it.  I was able to get alexa accept macro commands.  Alexa sends command but devices do nothing. I spend more time trying to get anymote and alexa to work than I would searching for the remotes to power on the TV, cable box and sound bar.

E. Wrye,0,"THIS IS A REVIEW SPECIFICALLY OF USING IT WITH AMAZON ECHO VOICE CONTROL ONLY: In its current state this is more of a novelty than a practical application. First off, the long phrase you must speak to initiate an action makes you feel kinda stupid when pushing one button could accomplish the same thing. Secondly, rather than sending the whole phrase over to Anymote then having Anymote parse the command words and figure out what you want, this had the Echo do the parsing and just send what it THINKS the command is over to the remote it THINKS you said. This not only requires you to choose super simple limited one word device names but the Echo doesn't understand many command words that it would have no problem understanding in other context. Also, Echo has an issue with compound words or phrases and will most often only send one word. Examples: ""Tell Anymote to Volume up 5 times my receiver"" ALWAYS makes echo only send volume up so Anymote volumes up once. ""Tell Anymote to Initiate my Samsung"" where ""initiate"" is a button you created for a macro to turn on your entertainment system results in echo either telling you it doesn't understand the command or giving you an example of what you can say with Anymote. Many words result in this - I went through 4 or 5 words renaming the button before finally finding one that echo would properly send over to Anymote. ""Tell Anymote to Movie Mode my Receiver"" will 3 out of 4 times cause echo to send only ""movie"" and not ""movie mode"" - this is typical with all compound words or any command phrase more than one word - echo will most often only send one word. Overall, this doesn't work well enough or reliably enough to be used for anything other than a novelty or something to play around with for kicks and giggles. Hopefully the developers will come up with simpler phrasing for the command and also just have echo send the entire command over and have their app parse the words and figure out what to do (hopefully with better algorithms). I know this would require way more programming but would add significant value to the Anymote app.",2016-01-08,a6c48ab7-e9ab-4387-a0b2-6d5e1bf5d0b5,2.0,AnyMote Smart Remote,1504379868.851768,ECHO Review: More Novelty than Usefulness Now,14

I would like to be able to say: ""Alexa, tell anymote to go to Netflix on TV.""  When using the Samsung Curve remote, it is easy but, the keystrokes are different depending on what you are currently watching so it you cant simply build a macro to accomplish this.

joel larson,0,"Given I'm not using the anymote ir blaster.Pros:Customizable, linking between remotes, backup system, alexa integration, has kodi remote, able to send network get commands which allowed me to port in voxcommando for more advanced playlists and control,Cons:Restores only work on devices of similar size and Color goes back to default, lack of reorganization when macros are built, after restore can't edit the network commands which worries me if the IP address changes since voxcommando voice commands have specific address, scheduling macros never works I have tricked the iPad by recording the voice commands and using Aida reminder app to schedule recordings at times I want my gear to trigger would rather a real time solution within the app.Conclusion: even with a few flaws this system impressed me enough to undo my windows controller tablet, swap to an iPad use anymote its nice that any iOS app could replace it if something happened and this is the only app/ skill that doesn't require using something like AWS and tons of leg work to be up and running .If they allow reordering of commands for easier editing then I'd give it 5 stars but it takes me forever to find a command sometimes",2017-03-29,d52619f5-d0a0-4c58-875e-522d8e9cbaf6,4.0,AnyMote Smart Remote,1504379929.2240572,Good start,1

Some people are blaming Alexa for this. I actually blame Hue. If i have 5 light bulbs in my house hue shouldnt be claiming itself as 40 devices on my network. (Which it does every time i scan for smart devices)The way i got around this: deleted all rooms in my hue app and put a letter next to each light name (ceiling light b for bedroom) then i used the clean up feature in the hue app. After that i went into the alexa app and told it to refresh devices then forget every but the lights i created. After that i set up my ""rooms"" by using alexas groups. Now i can tell her to turn on/off specific rooms.This workaround is okish for me but if i had other devices using hue or a ton of the color lights in my house i would have more trouble and more groups to create.

Certainly the technology gods are not arbitrarily deciding who gets to control scenes with their voices.  Today was the day!

Deleted the rest of the premade scenes.  My custom scenes have boring names like ""blue"" and ""pink"" and ""normal"".I probably spent a couple hours over the past week trying to figure this out.  Forgot and discovered my fixtures about 10 times with no success.  Well today I had to change out my powerstrip so I had to unplug Alexa.

Lauren,1,"*Review of functionality of app belowIn app seemed to be giving me similar problems that others have stated having: not getting verification text promptly, and unable to get beyond giving my cc info (error message of ""unexpected error"" would pop up and that would be the end of it). I use Lyft to get to work constantly as I am always on call, usually only get about an hour's notice, and live close enough that it's not a huge expense to use it to at least get to work so I'm not sweaty and wind blown by the time I get there. So needless to say I wasn't opposed to doing a little detective work to get it to work, scrolled down through the comments until I finally found someone who, instead of belittling those who could not figure out how to link their account and therefore gave a bad review, actually gave a useful solution.Got out the laptop, amazon.com, departments drop down, Echo & Alexa, Alexa skills, search Lyft, link account. At this point you will have to allow the pop up that amazon is going to want to open as the ""sign in to Lyft"" page, so if you have an adblocker, you should get a little notification when you click ""link account"", which will give you the option to allow it. But I mean, if you had the wherewithal to install an adblocker, I'd imagine you'd already be privy to how to temporarily disable it/allow a one time pop up window. After that, it's just like how it wanted to work in the app, send verification text, give cc info, hit accept, account linked!*As to how well the function actually works, I tried it out and I'm as pleased as could be. I asked, ""Alexa, I need a ride from Lyft"" (you have to specify Lyft as those dirty b*stards at Uber cornered the ""I need a ride"" phrase for their app), and she informed how far away in minutes the closest driver was to my location, then asked if I'd like her to call it for me. If yes, she'll play a bit of music (seems to change every time) until you're paired. It seems that at this point the music will stop, at which point I usually get a text from the Lyft app about my driver, but Alexa will also ask if I'd like to know if the app has successfully paired me with anyone so I don't have to worry about checking it on my phone. If you say yes, she'll give you the appropriate info about the driver like name, type of car, and eta (basically the information that you get via text from Lyft).

Things like relative humidity, expected snow accumulation, etc. Again, all these features will come as the technology gets updated.Lots of people saying it gives them The wrong location for their weather. This is because they didn't set their location in Alexa's settings. Once you do that it gives you the correct weather location. This is also true for the temperature.

Muse,2,"This is a decent skill to enable for Echo. Upon opening up you can ask Echo to list the sounds however she reads them so fast it can be difficult to keep track. I've compiled that full list below as of March 17, 2017. This skill needs some work as once you open it you need to issue it the direct name of the sound you want immediately it asks ""What can I do for you?"". Otherwise it will look for a band by that name to shuffle music for. It also does not really have the capability to switch between sounds, you will need to tell Echo to open sleep sounds each time and name the sound you wish to switch to.List of Sounds:Beautiful Dream - Electronic piano music, soft, slow and slightly sad. Personally I enjoyed this sound.Brown Noise - Sounds like you're sitting next to an industrial intake fanCity Rain - Moderate steady rain with slight drips on pavementHeartbeat - Plays a heartbeat at approximately 80 bpm with slight tempo variationsHeavy Rain - Sounds more like loud static white noiseJungle Night - Crickets, birds, insects, and some other wild animals. One of my favorites.Mountain Lake - Lapping water that sounds like waves from the wake of a boat.

Darren,0,"This is a great app that is useful for sleep, but also for background sounds when studying, writing, or reading. Really you can use it for anything. I've had the birds playing while cleaning the house instead of music. It's a nice change. If you want to use the timer function, try saying ""end"" instead of ""stop"" like the instructions say. For example, once it's playing, say, ""Alexa, end in 30 minutes.""

R. Seehoffer,6,"I've used this app for over a month to help me sleep and it has been wonderful until last night. The sound is now stopping after less than an hour and needs to be manually resumed for it to continue. I must have done that a half a dozen times last night. I disabled and re-enabled the app and that didn't help. I'm not sure what changed but obviously in my case I can't use it like this. Prior to this issue, the sound would fade out after about an hour and fade back in a few seconds. That wasn't bad because it wasn't distractful. But, now it just stops.Update--The Dev., Jeff, has been very responsive and has come up with a solution to the problem, which was apparently triggered by some Amazon change.

Well I decide the promotional lifetime membership is worth it so I shell out the fifteen bucks and follow the instructions to register.  But then nothing happened.  I'm out $15 and don't even get what I paid for!  Used to be a good app and would even be worth the money, but as is it is a total rip off.  Will be emailing the developer for a refund.

Kelsey,0,"I CANNOT sleep without a fan. Mine broke the other night and I had the worst time falling and staying asleep. With my work schedule I wouldn't be able to get a new fan for a few days, and I can't go that long without a good nights sleep! My boyfriend suggested having Alexa play beach noises, to which I begrudgingly agreed (I'm picky about my pre sleep white noise, okay?!).Once I downloaded the skill, Alexa offered to go through the full FORTY list of sounds! 40!! And it's not your typical sappy nature noises. I was over the moon when she mentioned oscillating fan. It was super relaxing, and the way the sound fades in and out it actually sounds like a natural fan sweeping back and forth. I woke up at one point in the morning actually expecting to feel a cool breeze on my face as Alexa imitated the sound of a fan turning in my direction.I will still be picking up a fan as we're mid summer and I need something to move air around my room at night. However this will be great come winter when I need white noise but don't need something adding chill to the air.",2017-07-08,e079901d-df89-4f3c-9278-d74b90eba95d,5.0,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381085.4429386,I need a fan on to sleep,11

This is my second opinion of the app.Yes, there are many different sleep sounds, but most of them are not free. However, I believe that a free Sample of the sounds are available for purchase because today, when I downloaded the app again, I was able to hear some sounds that are not free.Another problem that I've encountered is that when I asked the Echo device to change to another sound, she misunderstood my request and began to play a song from the Amazon music library (or store, since I do not have a music library with Amazon). In this case, I had to ask the Echo device to stop, and then ask the Echo device to go back to the Sleep and Relaxation Sounds app and start over again. I'm not sure what I was doing wrong, if anything.The bottom line is the app is good, but if you want more sounds than the app has to offer for free, you have to purchase them. I hope this updated review is helpful. Thank you.",2017-08-22,e2426426-1f1d-4e01-b167-07309457f3a3,4.0,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381085.498964,My Updated Review,9

Gary Fisher,0,"The Sleep Sound skill is a wonderful example of the versatility of the Amazon Echo; comparing Alexa with Sleep Sounds to devices which do only this one thing, this skill could by itself justify purchasing an Echo. With dozens of superbly recorded sounds ranging from Distant Train to Mountain Lake, Sleep Sounds provides an aural background free of annoying skips or obvious repeats as the tranquil audio samples weave themselves into the room environment. While Sleep Sounds is superbly suited to bedroom use, the quality and variety of sounds could also make it useful in many other settings; an Echo Dot tucked discretely among a grouping of plants, quietly playing the Forest Birds skill, could transform a sterile lobby into a welcoming waiting room. Highly recommended.",2017-05-16,1d1cdb0a-1941-411e-a5de-35537f4a1d0f,5.0,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381091.303284,Very Well Done,9

Patrick Brown,1,"I'm a new dad with twin infants and this skill was initially amazing for getting them to quiet down during feeding times. It was pretty simple: ""Open Sleep Sounds"", ""Play [Whatever I felt like in the moment.]But lately, there's about a 1 in 3 chance I will say ""Open Sleep Sounds"" and will be greeted with a five to ten minute monologue about new features (that doesn't actually enhance the experience I was already receiving), a tutorial on how to use a skill I've already been a steady or loyal user for several months, or (infuriatingly) a request that I navigate to this page to rate Sleep Sounds. Well, the coincidence of this request in the context of me trying to sooth a teething infant while Alexa's voice waking up the other twin is exactly what motivated me.The Sleep Sounds skill's competitors aren't just other white noise skills on the Alexa, but playlists I could easily generate from Spotify or Amazon Music. Or a cheap noise generator. Or a radio tuned in between stations. Or even a box fan or hair dryer. So it's a case of constantly attempting to ""improve"" the product actually gets in the way of the usefulness of the product when it's just as easy for me to never invoke it all if it doesn't work as expected.Perhaps if Invoked Apps did more to engage their users OUTSIDE of the Alexa... such as through social media or reaching out through Amazon's registered users, instead of making me wade through an interaction to actually get to the use case I want from it (basically... static).I have disabled the skill on Alexa and instead ordered a white noise machine for the living room. Is it hands free like the Sleep Sounds skill? No. Does it work basically the same way every time and doesn't blast me with product updates at 4 AM when I'm half asleep and my kids are fussy? No. And that alone makes it worth the money.",2017-08-11,a5a4c243-0c96-4342-9d81-d415cd0ff1cc,2.0,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381091.4082088,"Good Skill. Until it was ""Improved""",7
John Stuchal,0,"With 40 different sound effects to choose from, it is worth the price of Alexa just to use this.  You can control the volu MN e, and there is no break in the loop when playing.  If you have more then one Alexa, you can have multiple rooms playing, which is relaxing while working or if there is distracting background sounds.  This is also great to use if you have a dog that barks when he hears outdoor sounds.  Just choose a sound effect that has low sound tones.  This is based on scientific rrsearch too, when reading about preventing dog barking.",2017-06-11,5c83dbce-d86a-4d69-b018-106f6a541e6f,5.0,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381091.42911,As good as any retail sleep machine.,5
Stefan Harkins,0,"I can't recommend this particular skill highly enough. It makes almost every other ambient or relaxation sounds skill obsolete by featuring over 40 different ambient sounds within its own skill, such as: whales, Native American flute, cicadas, jungle night, wind chimes, and Sleep Little Babies (which was more of a soft classical music that I really enjoyed, so I believe it could be titled better!) which are some of my favorites!  I can't wait to see what they offer next, I would be willing to donate to support this skill. It's an all in one relaxation station!  I would also like to suggest that in the future they add more sounds, such as: New Age music, metronome, classical piano, harp, and dolphins (or dolphins and whales!).",2017-06-25,76350529-2364-4cec-81ae-df908ad00f54,5.0,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381091.463377,Makes Every Other Ambient Sound Skill Obsol,3

Doug Barnhart,0,"I was caught off guard when I said ""Alexa, open sleep sounds"".  Instead of getting the familiar ""Welcome back, what can I do for you?"", Alexa says, ""Would you do me a favor?""  I am paraphrasing here.  ""Would you take a few moments to give me a five star rating and write a review?""  She then goes into a rather lengthy explanation of the steps required to do it,  Since she said please, and asked very nicely, as a model to my kids I am complying with her request.  I am curious if Alexa will be checking up on me.  If I was to leave a 3 or 4 star rating, would she chastise me?  Since I did what she asked, is she smart enough to know not to ask me this again? I wonder if my AI companion will continue to ask me to do favors for her?  Does she have a sinister agenda, and will lead me down a dark and nefarious path, with her subtle suggestions?  She knows everything about me,  She listens to every word I say.  So I finish my review with, ""Yes Alexa I followed your command.

Having it on the amazon echo is such a convenience because I don't have to keep my kindle plugged in beside my bed so it would really be nice to have these options.

The Raven,0,"When the premium membership option recently popped up for this app I decided to give it a try. At first the registration refused to work and I emailed support.

The sounds are much better on the premium version and you can combine multiple sounds for your own mix. I had inadvertently purchased premium twice and they refunded me without question. I am now creating my custom mixes and find it superior to their unpaid version which was very good and helped me sleep at night for the last year. I really like that I got in on the lifetime membership for one fee. I use this app it daily so it will absolutely pay off over time. For a long time I use my iPhone and many different apps to do what this app does. The only problem with the iPhone is that some of the app developers discontinue the version that I paid for and create a new app- then if you want to have the sounds back you must purchase the app all over again.  Then there are other apps abandoned by the develper are no longer supported and do not work on updated operating systems.

Dennis M. Wierzbicki,0,"At first, I was very excited to use my bedside Echo Dot (connected to a Tivoli radio) to replace my Sleep Machine app I've been using for years. This would allow me to place my iPhone in standby at night, and would also allow me to use the Echo upon awakening (with the Sleep Machine, the noise drowns out the Echo's microphones).I enabled the skill, and went to sleep, and all was well...until 2 hours had passed, and the sounds suddenly stopped...then started again. I am a light sleeper, which is one of the reasons why I need a background sound to sleep more soundly, so when the sound goes away, I jolt awake. Since the sound quickly resumed, I soon was back asleep...only to be jolted awake once more in two hours.

KristopherJ,0,"Works great… Just tell Alexa to set the sleep timer for an hour, or however long you wanted to play.

Still getting used to ""communicating"" with Alexa, so this title is a bit of a mouthful to get ""running,"" but once it's running it welcomes you and asks ""what to play?"" That's my second complaint/feature request. It offers 20+ sounds but when you are in bed and falling asleep it's difficult to remember what all of those sounds are. Would be great to ask ""what sounds are available?"" and then choose the one you would prefer that particular night. Not complaining, just my 2 cents!

DRRamirez,0,"Listening to ""Train Ride"" reminds me of a favorite Hitchcock film, ""The Lady Vanishes"". The films main setting takes place on a train where a female character vanishes under suspicious circumstances. It feels as though you really are on a train ride and are a passenger with a ""cat bird seat"" view. Every night I play this sleep sound and I envision myself on a train ride that takes me away -- almost vanishing in to sleep.This skill set is an amazing skill set for Alexa; adding sleep sounds helps allieviate anxiety and provide the mind with constant white noise to facilitate a good nights rest.

At first I can interrupt to ask what time it is or give commands for more or less volume, play a different sound, tell it to ""stop"" etc. but after a couple of commands, Alexa ignores me no matter what I say.

Magoo,0,"LOVE this skill.  A few bugs to be worked out but they're minor.  Alexa sometimes has trouble accessing it and it would be nice to have the ability to stop one sound and start another.  However, it's not only fun to use, but this skill is really useful.  I find that I go to it more while doing things around the house than to fall asleep.  I haven't tried all the sounds yet, but I've worked my way through most of them.  City Rain and Wind Chimes are my favorites so far.  Hope the library will grow.

Meri,1,"Was just playing around with the sounds to see which one would work best for me and then I was totally creeped out. I selected Heavy Rain and instead I got this Blaire Witch type whispery voice talking about something I could barely understand between the raspy tone and my brain being focused on getting as far from the origin of the poltergeist voice that had taken over my Alexa. Once the rain started and my adrenaline dissipated it was alright but given that the intention of selecting a sound ment for relaxing immediately became an internal struggle to not wet myself from fear or have a heart attack, I think I'll try to get my rain sounds from a less haunted place.",2017-07-23,a2204e17-095d-4b24-81ca-b86e6a94021f,1.0,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381964.675849,That was more creepy than a horror movie!!,2

K. Chandler,1,"Almost useless. I already pay for Amazon Music Unlimited, but my Dot wants me to pay double to enable these sounds just for it. I thought that if I paid for the Music Unlimited on my Amazon Prime account, it would be for both my Echo and my Dot. Not the case. This is misleading. So I can't enable this skill on my Dot, which I have on my nightstand, and use for sleep sounds, alarms, etc.",2017-05-23,84153fa1-d6d0-411a-89d6-9166ed6c2226,1.0,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504382751.400984,Have to pay double price to enable sound skills on Dot as I paid for on my Echo!,3
