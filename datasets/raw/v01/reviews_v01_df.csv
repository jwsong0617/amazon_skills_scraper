R. Seehoffer,1,"The skill itself isn't bad--in fact I used it for a couple months without issue. My concern is that the pin code necessary to access account information, pay bills, etc is stored as plain text in Alexa's voice history list, and can be read by anyone who looks. 99% of people are not going to know how to go on Amazon through their PC and clear that history, or scroll through hundreds of entries and delete it from the Alexa app. This to me pretty much negates the security aspect of requiring a pin, and so I removed the skill.","on January 10, 2017",257b162a-8190-4db8-9fcc-b5fbdaa5e365,3.0 out of 5 stars,Capital One,1503627770.8015912,"Not a bad skill, but access pin is readable by anyone, even months after the fact.",27 people found this helpful.

Jeff S.,1,"Sometimes technologies can match up so well as to become nearly perfect solutions for some of the most challenging problems we face. Take the task of taking care of our elderly family and friends - Ask My Buddy steps up as one of those perfect solutions. It leverages Alexa's ""always on"" capabilities so that my blind 89-year-old father has the means to call out if his cell phone battery dies (which happened today), he falls or is otherwise in need of help at a time no one is around. This combination skill and service along with the voice-interface that Alexa provides gives my father freedom of movement and all of his family a greater sense of security.In fact, I think this company should be bought out by Amazon and incorporated into all Echo units by default since it offers such a vital service for anyone, not only the elderly, to send a quick message for help. It also isn't bad for Dot sales in that we are now buying 3 more Echo dots for various remote areas of the house to accommodate this skill's capabilites.

Brandon Slattery,2,"I'm giving 4 stars because I believe this may have pioneered an idea for Alexa that I'm all for- not only to be used as a life alert system, but for text messaging functionality in general.Although this doesn't fit a need for me specifically, I downloaded it interested in the functionality.  I enjoyed sending a text to my SO with a few words and adds a lot of novelty to the echo.That being said, I think the ask my buddy skill has been obsoleted with the integration of IFTTT.  I now set a trigger, I.E.- ""Alexa, trigger Send mom I love you text"" and IFTTT sends the text I pre-wrote to the number I define.  This is awesome...but I still want more.Using IFTTT, I've been able to send pre-written texts, and even call my own phone (find my phone) so the functionality is there.  How long until I can ask Alexa ""Call my secretary"" or ""send a text to Jim saying ""sorry brother, I'm gonna be a little late""  How long until I can use skype through alexa?These are the things we REALLY want.  The skill here may be obsoleted by triggers, but 4 stars for developing more useful applications than making fart sounds for this exciting technology.","on December 29, 2015",f72b673d-e7e6-4c4c-a4f3-13f686086327,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ask My Buddy,1503627869.375617,A step in the correct direction,84 people found this helpful.

Remlan,1,"Awesome app! I had one of the telephone boxes that require a sizable monthly service charges that continually increased in cost. That service took as long as five to ten minutes to respond, though it had no problem coming on (without using the cumbersome button necklaces or bracelets) in the middle of the night waking everyone just to be discovered to have been a case of a malfunction or accidently touching a button. The box hummedconstantly, lots of static and it ate electricity. I finally gave up and ended the service. NOW I have this. With two Echoes in my home I am always within voice range of Alexa! On a trial run, within 30 seconds, my hubby's cell phone rang with information that I needed help. I have him set as a voice answer on his cell phone and two others set to receive texts because that is what they use most often. Now everyone is happy because I can get immediate help.  If you can afford a small donation, they are pleased but if not, they only ask for a good review! As someone in poor health, I feel much safer than I did with the over priced box. This is a win win situation and it works VERY well! I am a retired nurse and highly recommend it for anyone with health problems who may not be able to reach a phone OR forgets to always wear that large button necklace or bracelet all the time. I feel better when alone and so do my loved ones. Highly recommended for anyone with health issues who may not be able to afford 40.00  or so, each month for something they may not ever use, or have access to. This is the best thing EVER!

F. R. Cox,1,This is such a wonderful service and quite a bargain when compared to the other Life Alert or Live Line type services.  I've found that these services charge you anywhere from $9.99 to $39.99 Per Month and do little more than Ask My Buddy does. I can attest to this because I paid one of them $39.99 per month for several years for my mom.  Bottom line is we want a service that if/when we fall we can call out and get some help from our friends or emergency services.  Ask My Buddy does this function very well through Alexa and is only asking $10 every 3 Months to help maintain their services.  It is well worth the money and I highly recommend!,"on April 5, 2017",716dfa8b-6f22-4f88-a140-0ecf868f042d,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ask My Buddy,1503627875.774028,One of Alexa's Best Skills!,11 people found this helpful.

Jude525,1,"I haven't had to use this in an emergency, but I have run a couple tests and the system has worked as hoped. Set up was incredibly easy.While it isn't a factor on the Alexa app, I have to say that the development team is excellent. After setting up on my Echo Dot I contacted the development team about using it on my PC and they were right there explaining what I had missed in the set up. They have followed up twice with me checking if I have questions on either device. You don't usually get service this good for paid apps!I have two conditions that make me prone to falls, but neither one is severe enough for my insurer to pay for a traditional emergency button. Although Ask My Buddy isn't the same as a  911 service, it does take some of the fear away from my being alone. Especially at night when I am tired and most afraid to fall.Finally, if like me, you can't afford the subscription service, consider making a one time donation to the team.

One thing I found a little confusing though is Ask MY Buddies ""Messages "" Page. I finally figured out these msgs arent for actual alerts but for scheduled TESTS.

Dwight Jenkins,1,"I'm glad I came back to read more reviews. The first couple weren't too good, but this is an important skill. You would think ""Call 911"" would be built in, but... so anyway, I first checked out the companion website, askmybuddy.net and then enabled the skill. Spelling seems to count, as Alexa heard 'Joni' and didn't think 'Joannie' was close enough... I just changed the spelling... but I'd like to see perhaps the top contact be contacted for ANY reason... maybe ask my buddy is all I could say before I pass out...  I'll also be donating to the cause... this skill my be free for us, but it costs to run, I know.

Meghan,1,"I have 4 year old children who my mother watches during the day at my house. We don't have a home phone and if something were to happen to my mom, my girls might not be able to find her phone and make a call in an emergency. Ideally if there was a life and death emergency, they would call 911, but I am not sure 4yos are a good judge of that and I am just as happy that they can use the app to alert an adult in our family and let us triage the situation if the adult with this isn't able to help. We have tested this a couple of times with them and it has worked well. Thank you so much for the direction and reminder pages on your site. It has all the information about how to use the app and I put them on the front of my fridge and next to Alexa so my kids could reference them in an emergency. The Alexa UI is such that for apps you have to use a somewhat unnatural phrase, but with the reminder cards, you have a better chance of remembering it. I think it is also important to practice this skill (having first warned any alert contacts) and keep the relevant phrases in your mind.I can see that this could have a huge impact for elderly people that want independence, but also might need to call for help verbally. This is a great idea and while I hope I never have to REALLY use it, it gives me some peace of mind that it is there if we need it.","on December 30, 2016",01e69bd0-a9a2-4e7f-99b8-65ed553a217d,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ask My Buddy,1503627907.668663,Could Really Help in an Ermergency,9 people found this helpful.

Widgeon,1,I have several serious illnesses that place me at risk for falling and other medical emergencies.

Marilyn,1,"Fantastic program! I am 60 and recently lost my husband. Although quite agile, now living alone, what if I should ""fall and can't can up""? Considered ""the button"" but it's pretty expensive. My son bought me Alexa for my birthday months before my husband passed, and all I could think of what's ""why? What am I gonna do with this thing?"". Everything in life happens for a reason. I now also have 2 Echo Dots and all are programmed and work beautifully with Ask My Buddy.  I ""donated"" $15 to Ask My Buddy which was an extremely small price to pay for this peace of mind.  I absolutely love this!  I don't have to wear the button and have Alexa/Dots on each floor of my house.  I only hope that Ask My Buddy continues to stay around for this wonderful service.

M. Richardson,1,This was one of the most important reasons I bought the echo dot.  I was so happy to have a far less expensive alternative to lifeline type products.

I did have to contact customer service to set up the app as it kept refusing my sign in.  They responded very quickly and gave me a detailed list of instructions which did allow me access finally.

jjaquinta,1,"This can send an alert or message to a list of people you give by e-mail, phone or text.Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. As with any skill using a linked account, this is a little tricky to negotiate. It took me a few times and some puzzlement to work it out. I was a little leery giving it several contact methods for many people. I looked at the terms and conditions but they were typically long and cryptic. There was no clear statement that I could easily see saying that my info was not being sold. I blanked out my information after reviewing, but there was no way to delete your account.Usefulness: 3 out of 5. If you are buying an echo for an elderly relative, there can be some advantage to this app. It works well for the ""I've fallen and can't get up"" scenario. But not so well for just about any other scenario. Maybe when there are more Alexa devices out there and you can use this from your smartphone or car, there will be more use.It's also great if you want to spam or harass someone.Novelty: 4 out of 5. There have been one or two calendar integration apps. But this is the first general alert one. I'm happy to see that it sends fixed messages, instead of attempting low quality free format text. As a sender of canned messages go, this could be useful for a variety of things. Say if the web end could be connected up to IFTTT.Overall: 2 out of 5. I cannot, in good conscience, give this a rating based solely on quality. Up until a few months ago I was an Ethical Hacker, and got a very firm schooling in security and privacy. You can use this skill to set up several contacts with a variety of contact methods and then effortlessly blast out a message to them as often as you like. There is no opt-in. The only way the sender is identified is how they choose to be identified. There's no way, as a recipient, to stop the messages. Sure, if used as intended, it is beneficial. But there is huge potential with this for harassment and abuse.","on December 4, 2015",20dc8d9e-db63-425d-84b1-4bbc1c5c99b3,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ask My Buddy,1503627958.907943,"Mildly useful, but very open for abuse",10 people found this helpful.

DiscerningConsumer94010,0,"This is a free service for everyone who has an Amazon Echo. The basic service will let you notify close family/friends in an emergency, and that's all most folks really need. Let the family members and friends you list as emergency contacts know that you've put them down to receive a text or voice call if you have an emergency. (This Echo skill does NOT call 911 directly).Contributing a few bucks a year lets you list more than 5 contacts and is totally optional. Any contribution is a nice way to support an important service, and even if you stop contributing none of your contacts will be de-listed. This Echo app is way cheaper than the emergency alert services that sponsor annoying TV ads for dedicated hardware devices for those living alone.Highly recommended.","on August 17, 2017",c9947f89-3564-491e-907b-c41446afa1a7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ask My Buddy,1503627978.250689,Better than free,0

Christopher Dittmann,1,"This skill is a sine qua non -- one you should not do without.  It provides a way for you to send alerts to one or all of your contacts letting them know you need help.  Perhaps you have fallen or are suddenly experiencing frightening symptoms, and you want to notify your son/daughter or care companion that something is occurring.  Send them an alert through AskMyBuddy!  You simply say, ""Alexa, ask my buddy to alert <first name of your contact>.  It's done.  I have not yet had an incident that required my use of this skill, but just knowing it is there gives me a measure of peace of mind.When you install Alexa, make this your first new skill.  Enabling is free.NB:  AskMyBuddy does NOT call 911 for you, nor should it be considered a substitute for calling 911 in case of unusual, potentially life-threatening symptoms (like sudden chest pain), for managing a pesonal medical emergency.  CALL 911 FIRST!

Bazinga,5,"FYI, for any potential users:  This app might be free, but you must pay for the ""Ask My Buddy"" service, which you don't find out about until AFTER you create an account. Extremely unhappy.  My elderly mother bought an Echo just for this service, and was led to believe it was free and it is not free.  The info, as we were in the process of signing her up, stated that if she couldn't afford to pay, that she could sign up for free, however there was absolutely no way possible to do this.  The fine print then goes on to reveal that they are a volunteer-based service and please be 'kind'.  They also discourage leaving bad reviews!  I'm sorry, but I think others should know about this false advertising. If I can help one person from buying an Echo just for this service (by being misled) then my time was worth it.  My anger here lies with the 'Ask My Buddy' folks for shamefully misleading an elderly woman.  I do love Amazon and my own Echo, but I'm wondering if Amazon has any fault here.  Surely I cannot be the only customer with this issue.  I think they should advertise ahead of time that you must pay a fee every three months for the service.  Why hide this fact?  Give people a choice before they shell out money for the Echo.  Just seems shady and I don't like it at all. Also of note, the Ask My Buddy website (wwwaskmybuddy.net) has no mention of a fee anywhere on the page. As a matter of fact, it falsely states that ""Ask My Buddy is a free service that leverages Amazon’s Alexa Voice Platform to connect a user to their Personal Alert ⨁ Network using only their voice. The service is designed for ease of use by all customers, and is a favorite of senior and mobility challenged individuals. Ask My Buddy is not a substitute for 911, but rather an additional tool for those trying to preserve their independence, offering the security of knowing help is just a shout away"".LIES LIES LIES.

Zombie Fan,2,"I have Multiple Sclerosis so I was very excited to add this app. I added my contacts and tested it out and it worked. My biggest issue with Alexa is that there are trigger words for apps. When I ordered Alexa with the hopes of it having abilities added like this, I had no idea I would have to remember trigger words for added capabilities especially in an emergency. Unless I practice these trigger words on a regular basis, I highly doubt I will remember them when needed the most. I keep trying to associate saying ""Alexa ask my buddy..."" with this emergency. Why is it not ""Alexa I've fallen and I can't get up..."" Or at least ""Alexa I have an emergency...""The site does have where you can print out these trigger words and put them in places that you might fall.  I find that idea ridiculous that it's needed in the first place.  Amazon, I expected much much better than these app add ons with trigger words.","on July 6, 2016",0424c264-7bb0-4a93-8535-ee809679a16b,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ask My Buddy,1503628087.4416718,Trigger word doesn't make sense and hard to associate with emergency,12 people found this helpful.

The idea of only having to yell out to Alexa to alert someone on my list is great as I do not think it's going to be that easy to get around at first.  I took one star away because AMB does not indicate who is calling.  It comes up unknown.  When the voicemail picks up AMB begins speaking then when you go back later to check who called all you will receive is a noise.  Many people do not pick up unknown callers.  The good thing about this is if your contact has e-mail or is able to receive texts, they will receive the alert there.","on October 24, 2016",295ab39d-8660-4cee-8fcc-8dadad4866b0,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ask My Buddy,1503628106.563798,Good way to get help by family members if needed.,4 people found this helpful.

He explained the type of phone I havethe Galaxy Note 4 a 3 year old phone might not be able to use some of the features, how ever after a long day of trouble shooting he gave me clear and simple instructions on what I needed to do which included the app update that included the fixes for my phone. He did say do to the phone type the answering the phone access might not work. So i did as instructed and BAM all but the 1 feature as he said worked. I can live without that 1 feature. He did say if I upgraded my phone to a newer version, that I would be able to have ALL features working. Well I love my phone so I'll settle with the no answering part. Everything else works amazingly. I'll leave my first review up so you can get the idea. 5 star for app, 5 STAR FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Thank you Nik for going out of your way to make a customer happy.  (Original review paid the $15.00 to not have to wait. I've been trying this out for over 2 hours. I have the amazon echo, my phone is the samsung galaxy note 4. I've tried all the features out. Most of them work and some do not. I'm disappointed that there is some that doesn't work since I paid not to wait. Here is what is not working. Send call to voicemail when I have a incoming call. Ring my phone doesn't ring my phone, accept an incoming call that doesn't work. Get notification's it says I don't have any when I do, when I listen to my status update it does not tell me I missed a call as it shows in your video. It does everything else perfectly so I'm half happy I'd give this 5 stars if I was able to have everything working since I paid 15 bucks not to wait. Any help would be great. I did disable the skill and re-enabled it, also I removed the app and reinstalled it to my phone to see if that would help and it did not. Like I said everything else works great but I'd like it all to work please. What do I do?)","on January 21, 2017",3048302c-00dc-430f-b49e-ed3265a27bcf,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mastermind - SMS Text Messaging & Phone Calls,1503628258.33384,Changed to 5 stars I'll explain why,14 people found this helpful.
Leander Carey,0,"Brilliant idea. The Android app itself is solid, works well, and has so far been completely free of bugs. The signup process is a bit complex but being a closed beta that's understandable. As far as the service & Alexa app are concerned, it works pretty well. There are little kinks here & there but far fewer than you would expect and they are quick to update to fix things, incorporate new features, refine current features, & take customer feedback extremely seriously & effectively. A few more iterations of the up, updates, & time to expand and it will be not only a solid five star app but perhaps the one killer app for the Echo there is. Bravo guys.","on February 14, 2017",c7b33f99-9874-416b-89d5-e81ff8a620d6,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastermind - SMS Text Messaging & Phone Calls,1503628258.351986,THE killer app for Alexa,11 people found this helpful.

Your not limited to just people who have the app, everyone in your phones contact list is good to go!  It functions perfectly and has no connection issues and messages are processed immediately.

Beth,0,I am moving back to an android phone after being on iPhone far too long. I know this app is coming to iPhone towards end of this year.  I am super excited about this App and it’s functionality and it will be one of the top 5 1st apps I download when the phone arrives in the next day or two. I’ve had the skill enabled on Alexa for almost a month since I found out about it and have watched several YouTube videos. Don’t give up too quickly. Be patient when using and learning about this or any app. It takes some time to learn the Alexa commands. The end result makes your screen time dwindle and that’s a huge plus.,"on July 16, 2017",4c0e48eb-2a2c-4686-ad03-9477018d1ac3,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastermind - SMS Text Messaging & Phone Calls,1503628264.6283479,Be more productive and have less screen time,4 people found this helpful.

Afterbyrner,0,"I think many reviewers have made the mistake of complaining about Blue Link and/or the pricing offered by Hyundai when rating this skill.  This is a review of the actual Alexa skill, separate from what Hyundai may or may not charge.First, this is a great start.  Hyundai is one of the only car companies offering this kind of flexibility so I have to give them credit for being at the cutting edge of blending virtual assistants for the home with cars.  This skill comes in handy from time to time and it definitely gives you that ""wow I'm in the future"" feeling when you simply ask your virtual assistant to start your car while you're still pulling your pants on.  I also have to say that many other companies can learn from this skill, as it's one of the only ones I've used that allows me to issue two commands at once (ie ""Start my Sonata and set the heat to 72 degrees), or just one command (ie ""Start my Sonata"").In practice, though, I've found that more often than not it's easier to just unlock my phone and start the car with the Blue Link app.  The problem here is that issuing the ""Ask blue link to start my sonata..."" command virtually never works.  It's not just me, everyone in the house has struggled with it.  The only consistent way I can get it to work is to ask Alexa to open Blue Link, listen to the lengthy ""welcome to blue link"" schpeal and then say ""Start my Sonata...""  And if that command fails, I still have to listen to yet another lengthy blurb about incorrect commands before trying again.  It would actually be quicker to run outside and just start the car.Speaking of speed, this is sloooooooooowwwww.  I can issue the command to start the car, walk casually downstairs, put my shoes and coat on, wait for the garage door to open and walk out to the driveway before the car starts.  That's not an exaggeration, that's my daily routine.  A major part of this is that Blue Link itself is maddeningly slow, but relaying it through Alexa adds more time to the already slow process.Overall, the skill itself is a great step in the right direction, but it needs to do better at recognizing commands, and Hyundai needs to speed up the process.","on December 20, 2016",26f13d71-8a16-46a0-b0b0-49ee825eb0f8,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hyundai Blue Link,1503628452.384568,"A great thought, slow to execute, misses a lot of commands",18 people found this helpful.
Joshua Johnston,0,"This is a good skill that appears to work pretty easily, but there are definitely things that could be added.  I should be able to set the temperature in the car after remote start, and not only in the same command that starts it.  Blue Link's GPS location feature is also rather poor in general, but being able to ask the car where it was would be a welcome addition as well.

Costs about as much as it originally did and now has less features available. Doesn't include map feature to locate car in connected package anymore. Save your money and only use it in the winter months if you really need it. Other than that, use any map app on your phone to keep track of where you parked your car. It misses half the commands because it won't connect, most of the time in the morning when I would try and start my car to leave the house. The rest of the features you probably won't use.

Barry Hughes,0,Good Lord people.  Starting with the 2015 Sonata/Genesis Hyundai introduced AVN 4.0/4.5 (do a search) which includes additional h/w supported functionality over their earlier nav/media systems.  It's that functionality that allows newer cars to be used with Alexa.  There will never be an update for older cars as the changes are h/w not s/w.  So either buy a newer Hyundai or don't buy an Echo if its primary purpose would be to control your car. I traded a 2014 Elantra GT for a 2016 specifically for the updated Nav capabilities which also include Android Auto and Apple Car Play.  For the record owners of older Hyundais won't be getting those features either for the same reason they can't use Alexa.

They said they would take 25% off our bill; however, the 25% was not taken off.  We called back again!  They said they would give us ANOTHER month free at the end of our year, so now we have two months free...set to expire June 20, 2017.

Christopher Dittmann,0,"Of course, I can't speak for Alexa's accuracy in all languages included in this skill.  Just French, Spanish, Italian, and basic very basic Russian and Norwegian.  She gets high marks from me in all of these.  If you are preparing to entertain a new friend or client who is not a native English speaker, this skill can help you learn a few basic phrases to help set your guest at ease and demonstrate your own openness and desire to at least try to cross the language bridge.  In that respect, you'd be surprised how little efforts on your part can yield such large results in establishing rapport and understanding.  Seen in this light, this unique and capable skill is a real boon.That's just one way I intend to use this skill.  I'm sure others will occur to me by and by.  It would be great if it went the other way, foreign-to-English, but that's very much more of a complex endeavor.Which leads me to comment on some of the negative reviews this skill has received.  To those reviewers, I ask, what were you expecting?  Berlitz in a box?  Alexa is a user-programmable device (read ""savvy user"" here), not a steel-plated United Nations employee.  Perhaps I should ask what some of these reviewers were smoking?In every way, this skill demonstrates some of the best things that can be done with the Alexa Skills Kit, the toolbox you use to develop skills, and it's clear from the user reviews of other skills in this category that Translated is out ahead of the pack.

I don't want to be reminded of this constantly! I don't know if the act of leaving this review will stop that prompt but either way, it's a crappy thing to do. I don't want to listen to Alexa lecture me about leaving reviews and sometimes, I just want to get a word quietly and move on with my life.

You can't just tell I to stop, either, because it tries to translate the command. Very frustrating, very poor. It's as if the designer thinks their program is the only thing Alexa does. They must think their program is very very important. It's not. FFS, if it doesn't understand me, it just has to let it go. I had to unplug my echo to get it to shut up.

I can't think of a viable solution for ordering something more complicated, though.

The second time you order, you can select the easy order that you created the first time. If you want a special order, it is way faster to do it with the app and would be so convoluted trying to use voice selecting pepperoni yes, olive no, etc. I think the only thing that would make this better would be to be able to add a promotion coupon.

I would love to be able to set up multiple orders for different occasions. Just being able to ask for orders by a preset list created on their website would be nice. I rarely order the same thing twice in a row, so it would be nice to have some variety.(Original Post - 1star)Says I have an invalid payment method. No noticeable way to correct what works fine for paying when using any other way of buying Domino's Pizza. so until they fix it, this is a waste.(Update below-11-4-2016 - one star)I have attempted to use Alexa again to order Pizza. I redid the entire account on both Alexa and on Domino's. From there website with all the same info I can order without any issues, but from Alexa I still get a generic ""invalid Payment Error"". It doesn't explain what is wrong with my account, and calling customer service from Dominoes, they couldn't see anything wrong either.Now, payment issue aside, Alexa hears the commands without issue and attempts to order my pre-saved order that I set on Dominoes Website, but I guess I've got to get off the couch and login to the computer and order the pizza the not so old-fashion way.

hma95,4,"We recently bought 3 amazon dots, one in the living room, bedroom and kitchen.  I read about both this skill and the my chef skill and started with what I though would be better was My Chef.  I have prime and have my husband under my prime account, so essentially we have 2 amazon accounts.  We would have to ask Alexa what account is this and since my husband does most of the grocery shopping, would have to first change to his account so the items would be put into My Chef shopping list.  Well sometimes he forgot and the items he said would go into my AMAZON list.  Then if the item was more than one word it would list it as separate item, like ""garlic sausage"" it would put on the list garlic and then another item sausage.  So it wasn't working out for us.  Then I installed OurGroceries, LOVE IT!!  You can ""link"" accounts so that no matter what amazon account you are on, when you say ""Alexa, ask our groceries to add garlic sausage to shopping list"" it adds it as ONE item to the list and it adds it automatically to BOTH our lists and is always syncing with each other.  The best thing, when he goes shopping and crosses items off the list, since the list is synced on our phones, it takes them off the list on my phone app as well!!

Tony L,1,"I tried darn near every list app there and they all fell way short until I found Our Groceries. First, it works across all my platforms, Android phone, 2 generations of Kindle/Fire, and on my PC in a web browser. Second, I can create all the different lists I want and name them as I want. Next, I can pick different sort orders for the things that are on the ""Buy"" list and the things I have ""Crossed-off"" my list. The Crossed-off list I keep in alphabetic order to make it easy to find things. For all my actual grocery items I have assigned the aisle in the store as the category. So i sort the Buy list, by category and all my list is in the order I find them in the store. I check-off (long press) each item as I grab it. They item goes to the Crossed-off list for next time and my Buy List scrolls up. Perfect and simple!When this became a skill for my Echo I was thrilled, but there were a few problems at first. First problem, my echo was not always understanding ""ask Our Groceries..."". I looked at the Alexa app when it failed and found it was interpreting ""our"" as ""are"". So now I just say ""ask R Groceries..."" and it works great. (It must be my mid-west accent...)Second, when I would ask it to add something to one of my lists that was already on my Crossed-off list, it would create a new item (uncategorized). I contacted Our Groceries support and it turned out to be a issue that it was not recognizing capitals and lower-case as the same. They fixed it and I am a happy camper.While I am in the kitchen cooking and I discover I am running low or out of an item, I simply call out ""Echo, ask R Groceries to add butter to the Grocery List"". So nice not having to remember to put it on the list later or having to wipe off my hand to do it immediately.I have lots of list that aren't even related to shopping. For example, my Library list has 2 items - ""Pick up materials"" and ""Return materials"". When I get an email notice from the library I have something to pick up, I call out, ""Echo, ask R Groceries to add Pick Up Materials to the Library List"". Then when I look over Our Groceries' list of Lists (a daily habit now), I see the count is 1 and I am reminded I need to go to the library. I can do the same for my RedBox videos too. Very handy!I don't know why so many people gave reviews saying it didn't work for them, but I suspect the problem was not with the skill itself.","on July 28, 2016",e396e546-2767-4f19-abf1-d285e3fd55a6,5.0 out of 5 stars,OurGroceries,1503628821.7600782,The BEST out there by far!,74 people found this helpful.

Instructions with pairing other devices could be a bit clearer or easier to find, but that's a detail perhaps.Unlike the default Shopping List provided by Alexa, this allows you to create unlimited types of shopping lists (grocery, hardware, clothing, pets, etc) and within those lists allows you to segment by type of product; e.g. with grocery you can segregate by frozen food, vegetables, dairy, etc.  And once you label (or change it) a product as say dairy, it will be categorized as dairy in any list you've created.  Categorizing things in lists can be extremely helpful as usually when grocery shopping foods, household goods, etc are all in the same categorical area.This product has other features such as barcode by a particuar product that I'm not sure of the value of right now.This product has nice possibiliities, it will be interesting to see how user friendly it is in real life application.","on June 13, 2017",462d36aa-995f-43c1-b012-c9952378311b,4.0 out of 5 stars,OurGroceries,1503628821.864179,Has Possibility,7 people found this helpful.

In an ideal world, we would be able to make OurGroceries the default shopping lists of the Echo, so we wouldn't need to use the slightly awkward ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries..."" line. But this is a current Echo shortcoming & has nothing to do with the Skill or the App Developer.You will, however, find that in most cases when you ask Alexa to add an item to a list, this will result in a new item being created & added, instead of calling up an existing item you've already created in the app. I suspect this could be due to the fact that in the OurGroceries app, new items default to capitalization (like ""Eggs"") but the skill adds the item to a list without capitalization (""eggs""). It's not too difficult to delete duplicates or make corrections, but it would be nice to not have to fix things, either.But overall it works well and has helped me several times when I am in the kitchen with my Echo Dot & my phone isn't available.

This app only has a single sort. The interface is not very appealing either. It has all the items that I have purchased in a crossed out list at the bottom. I could delete them, but then I have to add back the aisle category every time I add it to the list. My other app stores the item in invisibly until I need it again.

If you don't use ""Shopping List"", it can be whatever pre-existing list you've created in the app.Personally, I use OurGroceries for all of my lists (not just groceries), so I have a minor issue that's specific to my usage outside of Alexa - My primary ""Groceries"" shopping list is named ""A2-Groceries"" to ensure that it's near the top of my lists while keeping the rest alphabetical.  While I haven't tried asking the Alexa skill to add directly to that list, I have instead added a new list in the app called ""Shopping list"", which is specifically for Alexa added things so that I can say ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add cereal to shopping list"" as it's easier to remember.","on January 19, 2017",93f80f50-6eb3-4175-9591-20dda5b803c6,4.0 out of 5 stars,OurGroceries,1503628876.058468,Great - works exactly as expected.,2 people found this helpful.

Kelly Ness,0,"I like this skill. Reminds me of the text based MUDs and adventure games from my college days. I think it's frustrating that once you get on a certain path or sequence in most of the adventure you can't go back to the last ""room"" or area. Often you have to finish the mini adventure before you get an option to just go back to the starting area and go from there. Another frustrating thing is there are often multiple choices for movement or actions but choosing differently only adds steps to the adventure instead of changing the outcome or location you end up on. Other than these things, which could be easily improved, I've had a great time exploring this game and hope more areas and adventures are added in the future. And to those saying only little kids would like this...

AwesomeSauce,0,"I never thought a choose your own adventure type game would keep me so entertained. This one sure has. If you've never played one it's a little like the idea of Dungeons and Dragons but without dice. You choose which path to take in the forrest. One way may kill you (or actually send you to the restart area), another way will lead you to a room that you need an artifact from, like a key.Cons: it can be a little for frustrating finding the exact word it wants to complete an action. It's usually exactly what it asked if you wanted to do but sometimes you have to experiment. Also, waiting for more content. It seems i've caught up with what the game developers have written so far, in a week or so they'll have the next section done.Pros: Hours of entertainment.","on August 29, 2016",c91bdb6e-3339-421b-a2d6-0e1fe3a2b609,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Magic Door,1503629030.5666711,Oooh so much fun,7 people found this helpful.

David Walters,0,"I played through all the stories and did some extra exploring. Fun stories with different difficulty levels. Love the wizards tower adventure and the scary forrest (due to the level of exploration and riddles). It takes a while to get there, making the journey to get there worth it. I was a little bummed the bronze key is no longer needed ( I did find it). I like games that make you unlock things to progress. It also helps someone who just starts to steer them in the right direction so they done get stuck in an area that they don't have equipment or haven't figured out how the game works (i.e. do actions that Alexa doesn't list) Great puzzles and great game can't wait to the next part of the journey goes live.","on January 7, 2017",68313077-e433-41ba-844b-bfa94fa6b6b0,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Magic Door,1503629060.5624378,Fun stories with different difficulty levels,5 people found this helpful.

Mel,0,"Tried this out with my 7 year old son.. it's a good start, but could definitely be better:The first choice allows you to pick from 3 paths. After that, most of the choices aren't really choices that move the story forward - mostly just keep going or go back. Later on you get more choices, but these just give you more information about the scenery and you can basically eventually choose all options. Sometimes she asks you what you want to do without giving you options - we found that if this happens you can say ""what are my choices?"" and she'll tell you.Having Alexa tell a story - especially a story - is a bit boring since there is no emotion to her voice. They do have some sound clips to add to it, but would be better if they recorded this with a voice with inflection and feeling.Basically it was a really long not overly interesting ""adventure"" that we didn't even finish because she randomly turned herself off.I might try a different path on a different day to see if it's any more interesting, but so far I'm not impressed.","on December 26, 2016",73a1bd38-82eb-4971-883f-6a80ca3db541,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Magic Door,1503629150.2133682,meh,6 people found this helpful.

Michael Sturrock,0,"The time I spent “through the magic door” were unquestionably the most wasteful eight minutes of my existence to date. This applet is a blatant a pitiable attempt to stuff features into the Amazon Echo which, unless you have a spare million pounds for a compatible voice-controlled toaster, is only useful for music (assuming you have Spotify).From the moment Alexa beckoned me through the “magic” door and the manufactured door-hinge squeak noise sounded, I was sceptical. Even Alexa has Any film or scenario to date that has included a manufactured door hinge squeak has lacked any originally or plot depth. At least Alexa’s robotic storytelling matched my levels of charisma.I can’t remember what happened shortly after entering the door, but soon enough I came “face to face” with a small detestable rabbit. The rabbit talked at some length about trivial and annoying things, which was made more annoying by the fact the rabbit informed us that we were late for the princess’ party (to which he also was going).I don’t know why he would continue to talk if he knew we were all going to be late.The Rabbit proposed that to get there quicker, we could “take our chances with the troll” who may lend us his horse. I thought this was an odd way to talk about someone who apparently had a large enough capacity for generosity to lend a complete stranger use of his horse. Upon engaging with the troll, it immediately began to violently pursue me. At this point, it became clear that the little cretinous rabbit knew all along that the troll was going to be uncooperative. When I think back to what the rabbit said, its tone of voice was clearly laced with a level of deceit and malice only possessed by the most evil woodland creatures.Luckily, the story can be ended by a firm yank of the power chord in the opposite direction of the amazon echo. I can only recommend this to people with the brain capacity of wood.

Alexandra,0,"This game is ok when it works but a lot of the time, it doesn't. Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about:1) Sometimes when you tell the game to repeat a clue, it will respond with ""please answer yes or no"" and then it will beep to tell you that you got the question wrong before you even answered.2) The game will sometimes tell you that your answer is wrong, even though it's actually correct (see the photo attached to this review -- it is a screenshot from my phone of the voice history for my Echo). You can see that I answered the question correctly, even verbatim, but the game still told me it was wrong. Please note that the ""category"" text in between what the game said is the correct answer and my answer was actually for the question afterwards.3) Sometimes, you cannot understand what the clue is asking for. This is due to a mixture of a lack of proper inflection from the Echo and very poorly worded clues.Honestly, this game is just another example of an app that was rushed into existence with very little quality control (and the fact that it has not gotten any better over time leads me to believe that it's not actively developed).Overall, it's fun to play here and there but it can be very frustrating when it doesn't work as expected (which is quite often).","on July 5, 2016",be5ba422-f00f-4df0-8844-6cc0a6d9ad9a,1.0 out of 5 stars,Jeopardy!,1503629330.875056,Very Poor App,29 people found this helpful.

Other times, again because we don't have the benefit of reading the question on a screen like in the TV show, we get confused by homonyms: ""Known for their Razrs, this company... made the first... in 1984"".  Yes motorola makes Razrs, but they do not make razors.  Alex Trebek (or my own eyes) would have somehow indicated that Razr is spelled differently, Alexa did not. I guessed ""Gillette"". Perhaps different wording should have been used to clarify.  The communication breakdown goes both ways; sometimes when you ask Alexa to repeat the question by saying ""repeat"" she tells you that is wrong.  So much for bears / berries.  Other times she misses the correct answer entirely: ""what is a camel?"".  ""No, sorry, that is incorrect.  The correct answer is 'what is a camel'"".

Also, there seems to be some issue with accepting answers.  For example, if the hint is something like Madagascar is found in this ocean, the word ""ocean"" is therefore understood in the reply.  If I say ""Indian"", without attaching the word ""Ocean"", it counts it as incorrect.  In a few cases I've given the exact answer, and it's called it wrong.  I've had my Alexa long enough that it should recognize my voice!  While I find this frustrating, it's not so much that I decide not to play.","on July 14, 2017",d18c8dda-d68c-45d3-836a-52d9ee148e84,4.0 out of 5 stars,Jeopardy!,1503629337.119467,"A Few Issues with This, but Entertaining",2 people found this helpful.

S. Johnson,1,"So anybody who has an Alexa knows that she doesn't always hear well. Jeopardy comes with a ""did she hear you correctly?"" type feedback section that shows the question and what she heard. Except here's the problem: the answers aren't on the right freaking question!!! And inevitably there is one missing. How can you give proper feedback if the whole thing is a convoluted mess? Also, if you say ANYTHING other than ""repeat"" on the questions that you need to hear twice because a robot's inflection/pronunciation isn't always correct, it'll automatically count it wrong. So no ""um"", ""uh"", or ""huh?"" muttered to yourself before you say repeat. Even when you look in the app later and it actually does hear ""uh...repeat"" it doesn't recognize that as a command but as an answer.","on March 21, 2017",2d7c4584-fd98-4f2c-8238-8bfc3c6c2c9e,3.0 out of 5 stars,Jeopardy!,1503629343.16609,"HORRIBLE ""feedback"" in Ap",2 people found this helpful.

Just a few comments: Like  other reviewers reported, Alexa will sometimes say you are wrong when you've clearly given the right answer. This is extremely frustrating, I wonder if the Amazon techs are using this skill to aid improvements in voice recognition? Second, how are weekly stats compiled? Does it favor  the everyday player? I invariably score in the top 1% on a weekly basis, My daily scores more in the 5-20% range.

Lotus flower mama,0,"As a mostly stay-at-home mom, it's often hard for me to get really motivated, so I just tried this for the first time and I think it's okay. It's not, by any means, a GREAT workout, but on the days where you just don't want to do ANYTHING significant, it's enough to get your blood pumping and motivate you to do more (even if ""more"" is just getting a little more energy to get more housecleaning done!!)! I've done a LOT of different exercising in my life (but am in a slump due to a HORRIBLE past year!), including weight training, different forms of cardio, and Jillian Michaels DVDs (EXCELLENT, if you have the  energy and motivation, which I just DON'T right now!), so this isn't terribly challenging (not even breathing heavily) BUT it DID get me to MOVE, so that's more than I FELT like doing, and that's good enough for now! I will say that you absolutely MUST have prior exercise experience to do this workout, or you won't understand all of the exercises mentioned and, more importantly, you won't understand the proper FORM to do them, and THAT could lead to either a lack of results (IF you plan on doing this at least DAILY, if not 2 or more times per day!) or injury!

TeeMan,0,"It's a good idea but not executed well. Biggest problem is that this workout is only effective as a short, high intensity workout.

Better if it counted down the rest period and just started allowing people to say ""pause"" if they need more time.

I think the compliments and motivational words it gives periodically is funny. Restarting it between exersises if you take a break is kind of a pain.

Muse,2,"This is a decent skill to enable for Echo. Upon opening up you can ask Echo to list the sounds however she reads them so fast it can be difficult to keep track. I've compiled that full list below as of March 17, 2017. This skill needs some work as once you open it you need to issue it the direct name of the sound you want immediately it asks ""What can I do for you?"". Otherwise it will look for a band by that name to shuffle music for. It also does not really have the capability to switch between sounds, you will need to tell Echo to open sleep sounds each time and name the sound you wish to switch to.List of Sounds:Beautiful Dream - Electronic piano music, soft, slow and slightly sad. Personally I enjoyed this sound.Brown Noise - Sounds like you're sitting next to an industrial intake fanCity Rain - Moderate steady rain with slight drips on pavementHeartbeat - Plays a heartbeat at approximately 80 bpm with slight tempo variationsHeavy Rain - Sounds more like loud static white noiseJungle Night - Crickets, birds, insects, and some other wild animals. One of my favorites.Mountain Lake - Lapping water that sounds like waves from the wake of a boat.

R. Seehoffer,6,"I've used this app for over a month to help me sleep and it has been wonderful until last night. The sound is now stopping after less than an hour and needs to be manually resumed for it to continue. I must have done that a half a dozen times last night. I disabled and re-enabled the app and that didn't help. I'm not sure what changed but obviously in my case I can't use it like this. Prior to this issue, the sound would fade out after about an hour and fade back in a few seconds. That wasn't bad because it wasn't distractful.

mayfayre,0,"The sound loops are done seamlessly on this skill, and the sounds are very relaxing.  They work well to calm a busy mind that is supposed to be going to sleep but can't. I've listened to a lot of sleep sound programs over the years because I like them for relaxation, so I know the difference between those that induce relaxation and those that are inadvertently ""too busy"", or which aren't looped smoothly, and become annoying instead.

It even says the original content would be free to the original users but nevertheless I get the message that the sound I have been listening to for weeks is now premium only.  Well I decide the promotional lifetime membership is worth it so I shell out the fifteen bucks and follow the instructions to register.  But then nothing happened.  I'm out $15 and don't even get what I paid for!  Used to be a good app and would even be worth the money, but as is it is a total rip off.  Will be emailing the developer for a refund.

With my work schedule I wouldn't be able to get a new fan for a few days, and I can't go that long without a good nights sleep! My boyfriend suggested having Alexa play beach noises, to which I begrudgingly agreed (I'm picky about my pre sleep white noise, okay?!).Once I downloaded the skill, Alexa offered to go through the full FORTY list of sounds! 40!! And it's not your typical sappy nature noises. I was over the moon when she mentioned oscillating fan. It was super relaxing, and the way the sound fades in and out it actually sounds like a natural fan sweeping back and forth. I woke up at one point in the morning actually expecting to feel a cool breeze on my face as Alexa imitated the sound of a fan turning in my direction.I will still be picking up a fan as we're mid summer and I need something to move air around my room at night. However this will be great come winter when I need white noise but don't need something adding chill to the air.","on July 8, 2017",590bb630-39ef-4187-9fb2-f1ce5ae4656d,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1503629962.989569,I need a fan on to sleep,10 people found this helpful.

Gary Fisher,0,"The Sleep Sound skill is a wonderful example of the versatility of the Amazon Echo; comparing Alexa with Sleep Sounds to devices which do only this one thing, this skill could by itself justify purchasing an Echo. With dozens of superbly recorded sounds ranging from Distant Train to Mountain Lake, Sleep Sounds provides an aural background free of annoying skips or obvious repeats as the tranquil audio samples weave themselves into the room environment. While Sleep Sounds is superbly suited to bedroom use, the quality and variety of sounds could also make it useful in many other settings; an Echo Dot tucked discretely among a grouping of plants, quietly playing the Forest Birds skill, could transform a sterile lobby into a welcoming waiting room.

Patrick Brown,1,"I'm a new dad with twin infants and this skill was initially amazing for getting them to quiet down during feeding times. It was pretty simple: ""Open Sleep Sounds"", ""Play [Whatever I felt like in the moment.]But lately, there's about a 1 in 3 chance I will say ""Open Sleep Sounds"" and will be greeted with a five to ten minute monologue about new features (that doesn't actually enhance the experience I was already receiving), a tutorial on how to use a skill I've already been a steady or loyal user for several months, or (infuriatingly) a request that I navigate to this page to rate Sleep Sounds. Well, the coincidence of this request in the context of me trying to sooth a teething infant while Alexa's voice waking up the other twin is exactly what motivated me.The Sleep Sounds skill's competitors aren't just other white noise skills on the Alexa, but playlists I could easily generate from Spotify or Amazon Music. Or a cheap noise generator. Or a radio tuned in between stations. Or even a box fan or hair dryer. So it's a case of constantly attempting to ""improve"" the product actually gets in the way of the usefulness of the product when it's just as easy for me to never invoke it all if it doesn't work as expected.Perhaps if Invoked Apps did more to engage their users OUTSIDE of the Alexa... such as through social media or reaching out through Amazon's registered users, instead of making me wade through an interaction to actually get to the use case I want from it (basically... static).I have disabled the skill on Alexa and instead ordered a white noise machine for the living room. Is it hands free like the Sleep Sounds skill? No. Does it work basically the same way every time and doesn't blast me with product updates at 4 AM when I'm half asleep and my kids are fussy? No. And that alone makes it worth the money.","on August 11, 2017",03830086-e252-48a6-83c9-704593b56fdc,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1503629969.291948,"Good Skill.

I can't wait to see what they offer next, I would be willing to donate to support this skill. It's an all in one relaxation station!

Doug Barnhart,0,"I was caught off guard when I said ""Alexa, open sleep sounds"".  Instead of getting the familiar ""Welcome back, what can I do for you?"", Alexa says, ""Would you do me a favor?""

She then goes into a rather lengthy explanation of the steps required to do it,  Since she said please, and asked very nicely, as a model to my kids I am complying with her request.  I am curious if Alexa will be checking up on me.  If I was to leave a 3 or 4 star rating, would she chastise me?  Since I did what she asked, is she smart enough to know not to ask me this again? I wonder if my AI companion will continue to ask me to do favors for her?  Does she have a sinister agenda, and will lead me down a dark and nefarious path, with her subtle suggestions?

Having it on the amazon echo is such a convenience because I don't have to keep my kindle plugged in beside my bed so it would really be nice to have these options.

Dennis M. Wierzbicki,0,"At first, I was very excited to use my bedside Echo Dot (connected to a Tivoli radio) to replace my Sleep Machine app I've been using for years. This would allow me to place my iPhone in standby at night, and would also allow me to use the Echo upon awakening (with the Sleep Machine, the noise drowns out the Echo's microphones).I enabled the skill, and went to sleep, and all was well...until 2 hours had passed, and the sounds suddenly stopped...then started again. I am a light sleeper, which is one of the reasons why I need a background sound to sleep more soundly, so when the sound goes away, I jolt awake. Since the sound quickly resumed, I soon was back asleep...only to be jolted awake once more in two hours.

DRRamirez,0,"Listening to ""Train Ride"" reminds me of a favorite Hitchcock film, ""The Lady Vanishes"". The films main setting takes place on a train where a female character vanishes under suspicious circumstances. It feels as though you really are on a train ride and are a passenger with a ""cat bird seat"" view. Every night I play this sleep sound and I envision myself on a train ride that takes me away -- almost vanishing in to sleep.This skill set is an amazing skill set for Alexa; adding sleep sounds helps allieviate anxiety and provide the mind with constant white noise to facilitate a good nights rest. One good feature to point out is that the sound plays continuously until you request it to stop -- no time limit as with YouTube.Please keep supporting this app and let the creators know this skill set is a wonderful addition in the aid for mental tranquility.","on June 6, 2017",b5208043-c4f6-4339-aba6-16b8fb17bf7d,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1503630051.422629,The Man Vanishes,3 people found this helpful.

At first I can interrupt to ask what time it is or give commands for more or less volume, play a different sound, tell it to ""stop"" etc. but after a couple of commands, Alexa ignores me no matter what I say.

Magoo,0,"LOVE this skill.  A few bugs to be worked out but they're minor.  Alexa sometimes has trouble accessing it and it would be nice to have the ability to stop one sound and start another.  However, it's not only fun to use, but this skill is really useful.  I find that I go to it more while doing things around the house than to fall asleep.  I haven't tried all the sounds yet, but I've worked my way through most of them.  City Rain and Wind Chimes are my favorites so far.  Hope the library will grow.
