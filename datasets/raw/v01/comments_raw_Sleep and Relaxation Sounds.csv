Muse,"Thank you for the update Jeff. I am still working on compiling a short general description of the sounds I've listened to, there are so many which is wonderful! I appreciate the updates and feedback as well. I had figured that some of the limitations might not be from the apps but from Alexa itself so it is a good as a consumer to know. I will be updating my list and giving it an additional star as the app continues to grow and expand. Cheers!",3 months ago,b9d1d08f-a506-4119-a51b-9d7c268523f0,Decent Sounds,1504381085.24111
Jeff Bolton,"Thanks for the review and feedback, Muse!  The list of sounds is getting longer and longer every week.  Although we slowed the playback of the list down several days ago, we are afraid if we slow it down any further, it will take too long to go through all of the sounds. For that reason, you can find the full list of sounds in the description on the Sleep Sounds skill page.  We will continue to keep that page updated as we add new sounds.Unfortunately, we are limited by the Alexa system when it comes to switching sounds.  You can say ""Alexa, Next"" or ""Alexa, Previous"" to go from one sound to another.  If you want to go to a specific sound, however, you have to say ""Alexa, tell Sleep Sounds to play Thunderstorm"".  This is a limitation of the Alexa system and not something we can fix.  Hopefully, Amazon, will improve this in the near future.",5 months ago,eafc477a-3e9b-42db-8d0f-12c637c0d3a1,Decent Sounds,1504381085.241549

We've actually tried really hard NOT to provide too many messages or announcements...especially when you invoke the skill directly.

Try asking Alexa to play ""Train Ride"" and see how relaxing it is.

Jeff Bolton,"Thanks for the feedback, Thomas!  The small pauses are when the sound loops.  Alexa doesn't handle the start and stop very well, so there is a small gap when one track stops and another starts.  If we were to keep the volume up high when this happens, it would be much more noticeable and abrupt.  For that reason, we've chosen to fade the volume to zero and then fade it back in so that it doesn't wake you up in the middle of the night.  The hope is that you'd be asleep by that time, so you wouldn't notice it!The most common reason for the sound to stop completely is a poor or intermittent internet connection.  If your Alexa device loses its internet connection in the middle of the night, it will stop playing and we can't automatically restart it.  That may or not be the case for you and we'll definitely look into it and see if we can see some other problem.Thanks again for the feedback!

Jeff Bolton,"Thanks for the feedback, Yolanda!  By default, the sounds play until you tell them to stop.  If you want the sound to stop after some specified time, you can use Alexa's sleep timer function.  Once the sound is playing, just say ""Alexa, set a sleep timer for 2 hours"" and Alexa will automatically stop the sound after that period of time.We are limited by the Alexa system when it comes to changing from one sound to another.  Going to the next or previous sound is as easy as saying ""Alexa, Next"" or ""Alexa, Previous"".  If you're already playing a sound and want to go directly to a different sound, you have to say ""Alexa, tell Sleep Sounds to play Thunderstorm"" instead of just ""Alexa, Play Thunderstorm"".  We hope the Amazon team improves this in the future.",5 months ago,9af870fa-b568-450c-8540-18a48635e002,Sleep sounds,1504382300.376867

Jeff Bolton,"Unfortunately, this is a currently a limitation of the Alexa platform.  Once you start playing a sound, Alexa takes over and the Sleep Sounds skill is stopped.

If you want to go directly to a new sound by name, you have to say the full phrase ""Alexa, tell Sleep Sounds skill to play Thunderstorm"" so Alexa will re-engage the Sleep Sounds skill.

Jeff Bolton,"Hi!  I am so sorry you are having trouble playing our sounds.  There is a copy cat skill out there with the same invocation name ""Sleep Sounds"" and a similar looking logo.  You have probably enabled that skill inadvertently.  They only have a handful of sounds and say the exact words you described above when they can't play a sound.   To fix this, open your Alexa app on your phone and go to the ""Skills"" section.  Click on the ""Your Skills"" link at the top.  First, remove the imposter skill.  Look for a skill named ""Sleep Sounds"" by Invoked Apps.  It's logo has a dark blue background with white moon and stars.  If you see it, click on it and click the ""Disable"" button.
