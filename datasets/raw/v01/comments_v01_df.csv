LS Review,"Agree that IFTTT is a great feature, but I found it to be aggravatingly unreliable.  Originally had IFTT on my Honeywell thermostats.  Was a huge PITA to set up and only worked half the time if that.  Also had it for WEMO switches.  Also very unreliable and pain to set up.  Found myself getting angry and yelling at my Echo and even berating it from time to time.  Imagine how silly I looked.

AskMyBuddy,"Hello Stevie!Thank you for taking time to write a review!We understand your concerns about the phone number caller ID and would like you to know that the telephone numbers that the call and text message each come from will be the same number for future alerts. When setting up Ask My Buddy, send each contact an alert to verify they receive it. It would helpful to then have your contact add these two phone numbers into their telephone’s address book with a name such as ‘Ask My Buddy - YourName’ This way when your contact receives a future call or text message, they will immediately recognize that an alert is being received. We also created a Guide for Contacts to help explain what Ask My Buddy, Personal Alert Network is, and what alerts are. We have created a file that you may download, then print or email to your contacts. It is located at the very bottom of the Settings page. Go to www.AskMyBuddy.net, then LOGIN to your account. You will be on the SETTINGS page. Scroll to the bottom of the page and tap “Download AskMyBuddy Guide for Contacts” to download the file. You may print this, or email it to your contacts.You may also be interested to know about our Personalized Quick Reference cards that can be printed out. The Quick Reference will have the login ID, a place to write a hint for the password, and it will automatically add each Contact’s name with the command to say. To get a personalized copy, go to www.AskMyBuddy.net, then LOGIN to the account. Tap on menu item CONTACTS, then scroll to the bottom of the Contacts page. Tap on 'Personalized for Amazon'.

AskMyBuddy,"Hello Dwight,Welcome aboard!Thank you for 5 stars! We really really appreciate it!  Thank you very much for your contribution, we are very grateful!!911 emergency services does not allow automated calls, thus Ask My Buddy cannot make this call for you.  Your telephone is associated with a physical address, which allows emergency services to locate you.  Ask My Buddy does not have your address.  Ask My Buddy is designed to contact your personal network of people who are able to assist you.  When your friends or family receive an alert, they will know to check on you, and if necessary, contact emergency services on your behalf.   This method allows you to get help, but also to avoid the costs of accidentally deploying emergency services to your home.  We do hope to provide additional services in the future!  You are right about spelling - for names that Alexa passes to us that do not have an exact spelling match in the Contacts list, we use the Levenshtein algorithm, however there are still several that will not have a match, so we're glad you changed the spelling for your Contact.  An easy way to check about name spelling is to say 'Alexa, spell Joni'.  However she spells it, is how she is going to pass it to us.Also, thanks for the feedback about contacting a primary for any reason.  We do have a 'Primary Contact' selection, but we have not released specific behaviors for it yet.  Be sure to remember, saying 'Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help' will alert everyone!Best regards,Ask My Buddy Crew",1 year ago,3f0b7632-6e06-49f2-83c7-b4deff77ab71,Might save your life!

AskMyBuddy,"Hello John!Thank you for taking time to write a review!We understand your concerns about the phone number caller ID and would like you to know that the telephone numbers that the call and text message each come from will be the same number for future alerts.  When setting up Ask My Buddy, send each contact an alert to verify they receive it.  It would helpful to then have your contact add these two phone numbers into their telephone’s address book with a name such as ‘Ask My Buddy - YourName’ This way when your contact receives a future call or text message, they will immediately recognize that an alert is being received. (In the event of unusually high demand, it is possible that alerts will come from additional numbers, however this is unlikely.)We also created a Guide for Contacts to help explain what Ask My Buddy, Personal Alert Network is, and what alerts are. We have created a file that you may download, then print or email to your contacts. It is located at the very bottom of the Settings page. Go to www.AskMyBuddy.net, then LOGIN to your account. You will be on the SETTINGS page. Scroll to the bottom of the page and tap “Download AskMyBuddy Guide for Contacts” to download the file. You may print this, or email it to your contacts.You may also be interested to know about our Personalized Quick Reference cards that can be printed out.

AskMyBuddy,"Hello M.,Thank you for your review!  Please know that we have no plans to charge for this service, Ask My Buddy is a free service!  We think you may be referring to the review written December 26, 2015.  At that time we had only been available for about a month and we were not sure how many people would want to use our service, or how we were going to pay for it.  We did not want to mislead any users, so explained that we were in 'beta', a trial period.   With the support of our Ask My Buddy community, we have been able to let the community support itself, with our 'Pay What You Can' model.  Each voluntary contribution is what enables Ask My Buddy to be available when you or someone else need us, regardless of their ability to pay.  We are pleased that we are able to provide this service to everyone, and have every intention of continuing to do so for free.Thank you for your kind words about our support.

AskMyBuddy,"12/6/16Hello Shereen,We searched for your account and can see that the alerts that we are getting from you are not matching what is in your list: Ask My Buddy heard things such as:  'Alexa Ask My Buddy to alert an message' or 'Alexa Ask My Buddy to alert 5'In the Alexa application, on the Home page, you should see a 'card' that states what Alexa heard, and what Alexa passed to Ask My Buddy.  Please say 'Alexa, Ask My Buddy to alert 'yourcontactname', then please look to see what word Alexa heard and how she spells it.  If Ask My Buddy is having difficulty with a specific contact name, Alexa may not be hearing the name, or Alexa is spelling what she hears differently than how it is entered in your Contacts list.  Keep in mind, you need only say the Contact's first name.For example, your contact may be Kristie, but Alexa spells it Christy.  We do try to accommodate similar sounding names, but there are always some that do not quite match up.Try asking Alexa how to spell the names of your contacts, so you can see what Alexa hears.  Say, 'Alexa, how do you spell Lois?'  Then change the spelling in your contact list to be the same.  That way, Alexa will always get it right.  Don't worry, your contact will not know how you spelled their name.To alert all of your contacts at once say:	Alexa Ask My Buddy to Alert All	Alexa Ask My Buddy to Alert Everyone	Alexa Ask My Buddy to Alert Everybody	Alexa Ask My Buddy to Alert My Family	Alexa Ask My Buddy to Alert My Kids	Alexa Ask My Buddy to Send HelpTo alert only one contact say:	Alexa Ask My Buddy to Alert yourContactFirstNameCheck out our video on this topic. https://youtu.be/wS8XimY62F4?list=PLslNQPzAHWEmsGVMMiWI_g-p66WYP7u9DPlease contact us support@askmybuddy.net and we will get you set up.Thanks,The Ask My Buddy Crew",8 months ago,95be4852-b6eb-43e2-8ff9-0791d254712e,Not good

AskMyBuddy,"Dear Zombie Fan,We saw your review of the Alexa interface and using Ask My Buddy.  The Alexa interface can take a little getting used to.  We highly recommend using many of the various skills available to become, and remain, familiar.  I have tried to address each your points below (preceded by ~~~), but please feel free to email us directly - support@askmybuddy.net if you need anything further. I have Multiple Sclerosis so I was very excited to add this app. I added my contacts and tested it out and it worked. ~~~ I am very glad that you are able to use Ask My Buddy. My biggest issue with Alexa is that there are trigger words for apps. When I ordered Alexa with the hopes of it having abilities added like this, I had no idea I would have to remember trigger words for added capabilities especially in an emergency. Unless I practice these trigger words on a regular basis, I highly doubt I will remember them when needed the most. I keep trying to associate saying ""Alexa ask my buddy..."" with this emergency. Why is it not ""Alexa I've fallen and I can't get up..."" Or at least ""Alexa I have an emergency...""~~~ Remembering trigger words can be difficult.  Amazon continues to make improvements to the Alexa interface, and all skills will make improvements where possible.  We highly recommend using many of the various skills available to become, and remain familiar with the interaction.  The site does have where you can print out these trigger words and put them in places that you might fall. I find that idea ridiculous that it's needed in the first place. Amazon, I expected much much better than these app add ons with trigger words.~~~ The goal really isn't that a user would place the print out where one might fall, but like your local realtor's free magnetic notepad, having those trigger words in an often viewed place, such as a refrigerator door, will help keep the trigger words in mind.Again, Amazon continues to improve the Alexa interface, and so will the skills, including Ask My Buddy.If you have questions or need further assistance, please contact support@askmybuddy.net",1 year ago,491d4c3c-ceda-4fee-93b3-364a0e2169ce,Trigger word doesn't make sense and hard to associate with emergency

AskMyBuddy,"Hello Heidi,Thank you for your kind words and we appreciate your desire to support Ask My Buddy.  That is very kind.Regarding the name you are having trouble with, here is some information about names and Alexa's understanding of them.  Sometimes it can seem like no matter what you say, Alexa does not seem to understand the name you are saying.  If this is happening, try the steps below.  The thing to understand is that Alexa takes what she hears, then converts it to words, then sends those words to Ask My Buddy.  Often, she will spell names much differently that your Contact does.  If that is the case, the best solution is to change your Contact name to be the same as Alexa hears.  That way it always gets passed correctly.  Don't worry, your contacts won't know how you spelled their names.  Be sure to remember that you can alert all of them at once by saying Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help.  If you need any additional help, just drop us an email!  support@askmybuddy.netThanks again,The Ask My Buddy CrewHere is the additional information about Contact names.  If you can watch the video, it will help to understand what to look for in the Home cards in the Alexa application.Contact Names and SpellingIn the Alexa application, on the Home page, you should see a 'card' that states what Alexa heard, and what Alexa passed to Ask My Buddy.  Please say 'Alexa, Ask My Buddy to alert 'yourcontactname', then please look to see what word Alexa heard and how she spells it.  If Ask My Buddy is having difficulty with a specific contact name, Alexa may not be hearing the name, or Alexa is spelling what she hears differently than how it is entered in your Contacts list.  Keep in mind, you need only say the Contact's first name.For example, your contact may be Kristie, but Alexa spells it Christy.  We do try to accommodate similar sounding names, but there are always some that do not quite match up.Try asking Alexa how to spell the names of your contacts, so you can see what Alexa hears.  Say, 'Alexa, how do you spell Lois?'  Then change the spelling in your contact list to be the same.  That way, Alexa will always get it right.  To alert all of your contacts at once say:Alexa Ask My Buddy to Alert AllAlexa Ask My Buddy to Alert EveryoneAlexa Ask My Buddy to Alert EverybodyAlexa Ask My Buddy to Alert My FamilyAlexa Ask My Buddy to Alert My KidsAlexa Ask My Buddy to Send HelpTo alert only one contact say:Alexa Ask My Buddy to Alert yourContactFirstNameCheck out our video on this topic. https://youtu.be/wS8XimY62F4?list=PLslNQPzAHWEmsGVMMiWI_g-p66WYP7u9D",7 months ago,a94742ae-033b-498b-a069-cb53a69dbde9,wonderful app

AskMyBuddy,"Hello Chirag,We are very sorry to hear you are experiencing trouble with the voice interaction.  We believe you may be encountering a word / name recognition issue.  Please try the solutions below, and please contact support@askmybuddy.net so we may make sure you get running correctly. First test your account by saying: 'Alexa, Ask My  Buddy to Send Help' This will send alerts to all of your contacts.  This verifies that the skill is enabled and linked.Contact NamesIf Ask My Buddy is having difficulty with a specific contact name, Alexa may not be hearing the name, or Alexa is spelling what she hears differently than how it is entered in your Contacts list.For example, your contact may be Kristie, but Alexa spells it Christy.  We do try to accommodate similar sounding names, but there are always some that do not quite match up. In the Alexa application, on the Home page, you should see a 'card' that states what Alexa heard, and what Alexa passed to Ask My Buddy.  Please say 'Alexa, Ask My Buddy to alert 'yourcontactname', then please look to see what word Alexa heard and how she spells it.  Try asking Alexa how to spell the names of your contacts, so you can see what Alexa hears.  Say, 'Alexa, how do you spell Lois?'  Then change the spelling in your contact list to be the same.  That way, Alexa will always get it right.  Here is a video that shows how to look at the cards in the Alexa application.  https://youtu.be/wS8XimY62F4?list=PLslNQPzAHWEmsGVMMiWI_g-p66WYP7u9DIt is also possible that the Alexa device is not hearing your voice well.  First, use the Alexa application and open the Home page so you can see what Alexa heard. On the card that reads Contacts click the small down arrow in lower right to open fully.  A section will display for Voice feedback.  It will say Alexa heard ""... "" then ask Did Alexa do what you wanted?Click on No.Then step closer to the Alexa device and again say, Alexa ask My Buddy to alert ‘yourcontactsfirstname’..If she again says who do you want to alert, say Quit, then please repeat the first set of steps to let her know that was incorrect.Please, once again step closer and try the statement again.If she hears it correctly, then please click Yes on the card in the Alexa application.Additionally, it would be useful to run Alexa's voice training tool.  This helps her learn to understand better.  To access the tool, click on the menu in the Alexa application,Then select SettingsThen select Voice TrainingThen when ready, click on Start Session.For more information please see our YouTube video channel. There are many helpful step by step videos that will guide you through many things. The Youtube channel can also show how to use the AskMyBuddy.net web site.  Here is the link:https://www.youtube.com/c/askmybuddyPlease contact support@askmybuddy.net and let us know if this does not resolve the problem.Best regards,The Ask My Buddy crew",1 year ago,bd360493-ad43-4419-aa6e-d749fb01c942,"Frustrating, hit and miss to get it work.....very premature but excellent concept"

So glad you were able to link Alexa and Ask My Buddy, and also update your contact first names with 'Alexa freindly' names.We hope that we have earned your 5 stars, if not, please send email to support@askmybuddy.net and let us know how we can help.** For readers of this review: 1) Alexa and Ask My Buddy must be Linked as a second step after Enable.  2) To send alerts, only the contact's first name is required.  Alexa hears well, but does not understand all first names.  If you are having trouble with alerting a particular contact, look at the Home card in your Alexa companion application to see what name Alexa heard.  You may also ask Alexa to spell your contact's name, to see if Alexa understands you, or spells it different.  Then return to wwww.askmybuddy.net and update the first name in your Contact to match what Alexa understood.  That way, she will always pass a name that matches your contact list.  11/28/16Hello AvidAmazonShopperIt sounds like Alexa and Ask My Buddy are not Linked yet. Please please send email to support@askmybuddy.net  If you include your phone number, we will call you to help you get set up.Best regards,The Ask My Buddy Crew",8 months ago,d2b0eacf-e3cd-4962-b74c-f554170fd06a,Does not work!!!!

AskMyBuddy,"Hi again Christian, We haven't seen any email from you to our support about this question, so just wanted to add a couple ideas here, hoping you will see them,Did 'Alexa Ask My Buddy to Alert Everyone' work?In the meantime - here are a couple ways that this can happen:1. Alexa companion app not linked to the same Ask My Buddy account.After Enabling some skills, they must also be Linked.  In the Linking process Alexa 'connects' with the skill using the registered email address.  If this hasn't happened, or was linked to a different email address, then it is possible there are more than one Ask My Buddy accounts created.  (we have seen this happen when registering a typo is made in the email address, such as gmail.con or similar).  Disable the skill, then Enable again, Press Link account, and Log In with the same account that Contacts are seen on Ask My Buddy.2. More than 1 Alexa account / Household accounts - Alexa can have more than one registered Amazon account and if you have registered more than one account, you will need to have registered, enabled, and linked Ask My Buddy on both accounts.   You can check this by asking 'Alexa which account is current'.  If it is not the account that has Ask My Buddy enabled, then say 'Alexa switch accounts' and try again.",9 months ago,37f5fe98-5abd-4d0d-92e1-e81dfd6179ea,Contacts not found

AskMyBuddy,"Hello BX44XB,Thank you for sharing your story.  It is a good opportunity to let everyone know about Contact names and how Alexa passes information to Ask My Buddy.  I have included information about Contact names, and about training Alexa to understand your voice.Please send us email if there is anything we can help with.  Support@askmybuddy.netThe Ask My Buddy Crew~Contact Names and SpellingIf Ask My Buddy is having difficulty with a specific contact name, Alexa may not be hearing the name, or Alexa is spelling what she hears differently than how it is entered in your Contacts list. For example, your contact may be Kristie, but Alexa spells it Christy. We do try to accommodate similar sounding names, but there are always some that do not quite match up. In the Alexa application, on the Home page, you should see a 'card' that states what Alexa heard, and what Alexa passed to Ask My Buddy. Please say 'Alexa, Ask My Buddy to alert xxxxx, then please look to see what word Alexa heard and how she spells it. Try asking Alexa how to spell the names of your contacts, so you can see what Alexa hears. Say, 'Alexa, how do you spell xxxxx?' Then change the spelling in your contact list to be the same. That way, Alexa will always get it right. Don’t worry, your contacts will not see how you spelled their name. Visit our https://www.youtube.com/askmybuddy for a video discussing contact name spelling and how to look at the cards in the Alexa application.  ~Additionally, to help Alexa understand you better, there are two training exercises you can do.~Skill info-card result trainingWhen using Ask My Buddy and other skills, ‘Cards’ are created in the Alexa application, on the Home page.  You can assist Alexa in understanding by responding to the cards as outlined in the steps below:First, use the Alexa application and open the Home page so you can see what Alexa heard.On the card that reads Contacts click the small down arrow in lower right to open fully.  A section will display for Voice feedback.  It will say Alexa heard ""... "" then ask Did Alexa do what you wanted?Click on No.Then step closer to the Alexa device and again say, Alexa ask My Buddy to alert ‘yourcontactsfirstname’.If she again says, ‘Who do you want to alert?’, say Quit, then please repeat the first set of steps to let her know that was incorrect.Please, once again step closer and try the statement again.  If she hears it correctly, then please click Yes on the card in the Alexa application.~Alexa's voice training toolAdditionally, it would be useful to run Alexa's voice training tool.  This helps her learn to understand better.  To access the tool, click on the menu in the Alexa application,Then select SettingsThen select Voice TrainingThen when ready, click on Start Session.",7 months ago,3dbc4252-658d-446b-83ab-215172d8e016,I am from Boston so when I asked for buddy ...

While it is true that I had the initial setup problems discussed above, Customer Service for Ask My Buddy was *very* responsive and promptly offered to help me through it. They suggested (above) that I try clicking ""Forgot Password,"" and I did that to see if I could successfully create a Password (and thus an account) that way. Sure enough, that worked without a hitch. So now we're good. I haven't needed to use this skill in ""real life"" experience yet (one hopes to never need it, like insurance, I guess), so I can't review the skill on how it performs when needed, but at this point (and given the other reviews here), I am confident it would serve the occasion just fine.

If you need anything, please send email to support@askmybuddy.netBest regards,Ask My Buddy CrewAbout Ask My Buddy skillWe’re all alone sometimes, which is why everyone needs Ask My Buddy, because you can NOT predict when you will need help.If you have fallen, or need help, Ask My Buddy lets you immediately alert someone that you need them to check on you.  You may alert just 1 contact or all of your friends or family with just one command.  Simply say, 'Alexa, Ask My Buddy to alert YourContact' or 'Alexa, Ask My Buddy to everyone', and Ask My Buddy will immediately send an alert, notifying them to check on you right away.  Alerts will be sent by text message / SMS, an email, and even a voice telephone call.  Ask My Buddy is not a substitute for 911, but rather an additional tool offering the security of knowing help is just a shout away.https://youtu.be/HentE0DtUe8",10 months ago,c3abe5fd-cf31-434d-92bc-393bbacb023b,Bev

Nik Bhattacharya,"Hi, this is Nik Bhattacharya, the Co Founder of MastermindFirst of all, really sorry that you are having issues with recognizing the names in your contact book. It is no doubt frustrating when you try to say something and it either doesn't recognize it or it matches something else. Alexa has a major flaw in that it does not allow for only the names in your contact book to be the names that are trained for name matching. As skill developers , we have to enter every possible name (including mom, dad, sister but also really complex and hard names as we have users from all over the world). Then when you say ""Ask Mastermind to text {SoandSo}"", Alexa will give us what she thinks she heard as the {name}. It is quite frustrating for us when we say a name and Alexa gives us a totally different input from what we said (which is exactly what you are running into). We then have to take a completely garbage input from Alexa and match it to something in your address book. Try this for yourself, go to the Amazon Alexa app on your phone, open the Settings and then go to History. Then start saying Mastermind commands (""ask Mastermind to lookup contact"" is often a good command to try). Then start saying names of your friends (even better if they have non-anglo names). You will see exactly what Alexa gives us to work with. We have to match that to something meaningful. You will see why writing Mastermind was extremely difficult and required us to do some complex phonetics and artificial intelligence algorithms to just get it to work. We really hope Amazon is going to do a better job of speech to text soon.We are happy to give you a full refund of your money. You should not have to be frustrated. Again, hope you understand that we do our best. Please send us your receipt at support@convessa.com and we will make sure you are refunded your money. We continue to improve our algorithms and software and do more than any other skill in the Alexa skill store. We do hope Alexa's tools become better to help make the experience better as a whole.

Nik Bhattacharya,"Hi Loren, I am the co founder of Mastermind. First off, thanks for getting into the closed beta. Mastermind is the most complex skill for Alexa there is. We developed the product for over a year before we launched on Alexa so that we respect our beta user's time and money. Of course, we want to be perfect and work on all devices. We support 3877 variants of Android smartphones (yes, that is a LOT) and sometimes find that a particular variant of them has odd problems that users like yourself bring to our attention. Hence too the closed beta so we can work through most of these before we do the open launch of a paid subscription service for Mastermind. That being said, we will be happy to work with you to resolve your issues as far as we can. Could you email support@convessa.com from the Gmail that you used to sign in to Mastermind? We have tested extensively on many different phones and the Note 4 is almost 3 years old and has been known to have bugs in their Android implementation. The sad part is that in this day-and-age, you almost have to get a new phone every two years or so :-(  All the features that you saw in the video are real shots of Mastermind working, so we can assure you that it actually does work. It is likely that your particular phone has some features that prevent Mastermind from doing it's job in its entirety. Let's see if we can resolve that. We thank you again and look forward to your email to support@convessa.com and let's take it from there.

Amazon Customer,"Hi John, this is Nik Bhattacharya, the co founder of Mastermind.Thanks for the excellent feedback. Yes, absolutely reasonable request. We will need to think through the ramifications of this request in its entirety. For example, Alexa is no longer just going to be at home. It is already available in the car (inbuilt into some newer cars and available via an app like Reverb), and also will be available to you on your phone (hopefully it will be available through bluetooth so you can just command Alexa through your bluetooth headset just like you can do today with OK Google). So a global turn it off will also mean that you yourself could not access Mastermind when you are away from home and on other devices. Which may be ok now, but in about 6 months, we really see Alexa becoming more ubiquitous and with you everywhere. Again, great idea. Let us do some product design around this in the upcoming months and we will definitely have something to protect your privacy. We take privacy very very seriously and already do complete end-to-end encryption of all data that is transferred. While we design this, if you want to chime in with some thoughts yourself on how to achieve this (which toggles, when etc) we would love that.Best,Nik Bhattacharyaco founder of Mastermind",5 months ago,3b2f7fde-19db-442a-80b0-7318e1b9b6fb,Awesome so far

Nik Bhattacharya,"Hi,Mastermind has everything built in to make a call through Alexa (essentially making a bluetooth call). However, as of today, Amazon Echo and Dot devices don’t support bluetooth call pairing (Amazon only allows ""themselves"" to use the calling function and use the Echo as a speakerphone and not made that function available to third parties).We have found a simple workaround to enable completely hands free calling from Alexa. The caveat is that you will need to buy one more piece of hardware at home (a bluetooth speaker with a microphone that supports mobile voice calls). With a device like this, you can use Mastermind to make and receive phone call completely hands-free through Alexa and the above bluetooth speaker/mic without touching your phone. The interaction would go like this:** Alexa, ask Mastermind to Turn on Bluetooth ** (this pairs your phone to the bluetooth speaker)** Alexa, ask Mastermind to Call John Smith ** (the call will be initiated by your Alexa and the interaction will be on your bluetooth speaker/mic. The phone might still be in the bedroom charging and you never have to touch it.)…after the phonecall** Alexa, ask Mastermind to Hangup **You can either choose to leave your phone paired to your bluetooth speaker or you can choose to disconnect the pairing by saying “Alexa, ask Mastermind to turn off Bluetooth”.  It is unfortunate that the Amazon Echo does not support phone calls through their bluetooth pairing yet, but we hope they enable that in the near future. A device like Jabra Speak510 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker for Softphone and Mobile Phone (please note that we are not necessarily recommending this product, just that we are in the early test phase and it seems to be doing an adequate job) can be the bridge to allow hands-free bluetooth calling through Mastermind and Alexa till Amazon supports bluetooth phone calls directly on the Echo.

Please email us at support@convessa.com and we can help you out via that channel. We would love to enable the call through the Alexa device itself, but Amazon has not made that function available to non-Amazon skills (the ability to make a bluetooth call from your phone that goes via your Amazon speaker). We did post a detailed video on Youtube on how to make a completely hands free call to anybody in your contacts (whether they have Alexa or not) via Mastermind.

Mastermind is one of the most complex skills available on Alexa and supports over 30 different flows and commands out of the box.

We are working with Amazon to let them know what we are finding regarding their speech recognition. Ultimately, it will be up to Amazon to implement these or decide not to. We understand that this can be frustrating as you really want everything to work. When Alexa is having a good day, all is beautiful.

Nik Bhattacharya,"Hi, Apple support is planned for late 2017. The key premise of Mastermind is full accessibility of your phone from Alexa without touching your phone. 30 features spanning SMS text messaging using your carrier assigned number, making phone calls, getting all your notifications, launching apps, getting data usage etc.Apple gives 3rd party applications very limited ability to integrate deeply with the phone. We do not want Mastermind users to sign up for a completely new SMS/Phone number. Users should be able to use their existing phone number so they can use a service they are already paying for and not confuse their friends and family with a new number. Unfortunately, as of right now Apple neither allows third party applications to send or receive a text message on your behalf nor place an outgoing phone call for you. We are trying to figure out if there are acceptable workarounds to these restrictions that Apple puts on third parties even if the iPhone user is completely ok with an app like Mastermind to do things like send messages and make phone calls.So Apple users, stay tuned. We will have something great for you. It may just be of a slightly different flavor than the dish we are currently serving your Android cousins.Best,Nik BhattacharyaCo Founder of Mastermind",3 months ago,6a8cbaab-00db-407e-be73-0ac97293423f,iPhones??????

Nik Bhattacharya,"I am a co-founder of Mastermind. Now that you have been given access, would you be kind enough to update your review?Mastermind is one of the most complex skills available for Alexa and we have spent well over a year in R&D before we made it available. We launched it in closed beta so we can slowly add people to the system to make sure we handle scaling correctly. That is the reason behind the waitlist. You do not have to pay to be a part of our beta. We already added 10% of the people on the waitlist into the beta. Everyday, we add more users from the waitlist into the beta, so if you are on the waitlist you just have to be a bit patient. We provide a way for people to get priority access for free. We add people from the waitlist to the beta who have both the Alexa app and Android companion app linked before people with just the skill installed.People who don't want to wait can **optionally** pay $15 one time to get instant access to the beta. We are making changes to make this more clear that this is completely optional. It's important to note that the vast majority of people in the beta did not have to pay anything.We take your feedback seriously. If you have the Android app and the Alexa skill installed, you will most likely get into the closed beta within the next couple weeks. We would appreciate it if you update the review as you have used some words that could seriously undermine our efforts to provide you with a high quality product and not a sham.  More details about the closed beta: http://mastermindbot.com/2016/12/18/mastermindclosedbetanowavailable/More details about Mastermind: http://mastermindbot.com/See Mastermind in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGgNa4OYARc&t=2sI hope this addresses your concerns,Nik BhattacharyaCo-Founder of Mastermind & Co-CEO of Convessa, Inc.http://www.mastermindbot.comhttp://www.convessa.com",7 months ago,68bf0dc9-9515-4a43-bd8e-9ee8e613d8c1,Beware

Nik Bhattacharya,"Hi Bruce, this is Nik Bhattacharya, the co founder of Mastermind. We are not a scam, just a really **high quality skill** that we have launched in closed beta after spending more than a year in research and development because of how complex and powerful it is. Our terms of the closed beta are very clearly written on the Alexa Skill listing. We would be happy to hear from you if you think we could make it more explicit.  Please contact us at support@convessa.com if you have constructive feedback. We would love to hear from you.Just in case you did miss the terms we have on the closed beta, I have appended it word-for-word below. Thank you for your interest in Mastermind.****************************************************IMPORTANT TERMSMastermind is currently in closed beta. Due to the high demand we are seeing, when you enable the skill you will be added to a waitlist. Every day we grant people on the waitlist access to the beta. The waitlist is necessary to ensure that our system scales correctly. You do not have to pay to be part of the beta, but just have to wait your turn. Link both the Alexa Skill and Android App and you will be given priority access (i.e. moved in-front of people without both linked). We will email you when you have been added to the beta.For those who wish to bypass the waitlist, we have a paid option for US $15 that will give you instant access to all the functionality of Mastermind during the closed beta. See the Mastermind Android companion app for details. The users who pay for instant access will get the first year for free when Mastermind comes out of closed beta and moves to a paid subscription service model.Only enable the skill if you wish to be part of the closed beta as per the terms above.****************************************************",6 months ago,ea408f3c-1c6d-4b3c-bc7f-8b48b08bc4e9,Scam to get $15

punkins,Not sure if you're aware of this but when you link two amazon accounts in a household you get an alexa shopping list and to do list that you can both access from your phones from basically any amazon app too. I have 3 different amazon apps on my phone oddly enough and I can see the alexa shopping list from all of them. I messed around in the settings of the alexa app and there's an option to manage your alexa lists in any of the following apps: Any.do and Todoist. They might be worth looking at as well.

R. Donnell,Thanks! I added my husband under household with his old email Amazon account. I set up his Echo with his name and linked the grocery account and his Spotify. He needs to get the my Alexa app and add whatever other skills he wants I just did it online under his account. I also didn't know you could say switch accounts so if he doesn't want to use it I can use it under my account but now I have one in our den and one out in the living room. But I think when I talk to mine whatever I say shows up in his history also it look like it was doing that and I don't like that but I'm not sure. But I told him he needs to get the grocery app on his phone but yeah I like this app okay. Using my husband will text me I'm going to the grocery what do you need? Now I told him it'll be on the list on this phone because we always forgot and never really synched out of milk together.,7 months ago,83349192-21e7-434d-923b-951ccd4ea646,This fit our needs better than My Chef!
hma95,"Yes I had the same thoughts as you at first, I guess it really depends on what each individuals needs and wants are.  In the Alexa app, under settings you can add a ""household"" member there.  Sorry I can't remember the all the details of it.  We used Out of Milk all the time also before switching to this app, so this could be a good fit for you since it sounds like you want the same thing we were looking for.  Hope it works just as well for you, we learned you have to pronounce your words very clearly with some wording and make sure you start with ""Alexa, (short pause) ask our Groceries""  then say what you want to add ""to shopping list""  Or what ever list you created in the app. :)",7 months ago,fd7dfe4c-004d-4faf-95e9-642141789f1f,This fit our needs better than My Chef!
R. Donnell,I have Prime also and my husband uses my account and logs in under my email can he have his own name under my account or with his email?  I bought him an echo dot also which he hasn't decided if he's gonna set it up and keep it or not but if not I would like one in another room. But we use Out Of Milk and I have grocery IQ that I've used in the past on our phones but now I want to delete those and get the best one to work with Alexa and have him get it too so even if he doesn't keep his dot when I add it to the list I would like it to go to his phone. I just searched for Grocery under skills and 3 came up and neither have the best ratings. 2 have 3 starts and one has 2 stars. But after reading your review I think I'll get our groceries.

Barry,"The same thing happens to me, too.  I speak very clearly; ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add milk to shopping list.""  Alexa says, ""I've added milk to your shopping list.""  Then I go to OurGroceries app and nothing!  I go to Any.do or Todoist apps and there it is, the word ""milk"".  'They' have made it so difficult with such a long app name, that Alexa (in my opinion) gets confused, picks up the word ""milk"" and drops it into the default list.  They have also selected two very expensive apps to work with Alexa (Any,do and Todoist apps); one sorts and one prints, but neither do both, so I have to use them both to get the job done.  Bummer!  The only good shopping list app is called, ""Shopping List.""  It sorts, prints and syncs with all your devices.  Come on people, you know you can do better - so why don't you??

Jeff Bolton,"Thanks for the review and feedback, Muse!  The list of sounds is getting longer and longer every week.  Although we slowed the playback of the list down several days ago, we are afraid if we slow it down any further, it will take too long to go through all of the sounds. For that reason, you can find the full list of sounds in the description on the Sleep Sounds skill page.  We will continue to keep that page updated as we add new sounds.Unfortunately, we are limited by the Alexa system when it comes to switching sounds.  You can say ""Alexa, Next"" or ""Alexa, Previous"" to go from one sound to another.  If you want to go to a specific sound, however, you have to say ""Alexa, tell Sleep Sounds to play Thunderstorm"".  This is a limitation of the Alexa system and not something we can fix.

Jeff Bolton,"Thanks for the feedback, Thomas!  The small pauses are when the sound loops.  Alexa doesn't handle the start and stop very well, so there is a small gap when one track stops and another starts.  If we were to keep the volume up high when this happens, it would be much more noticeable and abrupt.  For that reason, we've chosen to fade the volume to zero and then fade it back in so that it doesn't wake you up in the middle of the night.  The hope is that you'd be asleep by that time, so you wouldn't notice it!The most common reason for the sound to stop completely is a poor or intermittent internet connection.  If your Alexa device loses its internet connection in the middle of the night, it will stop playing and we can't automatically restart it.  That may or not be the case for you and we'll definitely look into it and see if we can see some other problem.Thanks again for the feedback!  It's very important to us!Jeff",5 months ago,94501afe-b41b-4bef-811a-fe492a78a497,Little Buggy

Jeff Bolton,Thanks for the feedback!  It's interesting how people can have totally different opinions about something.  There are many people who love the thunderstorm sound exactly because of it's rain and white noise qualities with a hint of thunder.  Others would prefer to have thunder only.

Jeff Bolton,"Hi Kaela!  The sounds in Sleep Sounds are designed to eliminate background noise to help you get a great night's sleep or relax.  The sounds work so well that they sometimes filter out the sound of your own voice.  If you are having trouble stopping the sounds,  you may have to move close to the device and in a loud commanding voice, say ""Alexa, stop"". You can also press the pause button on the device.",4 months ago,e66858c2-10ac-48f3-9ef0-85bf02e774e6,alexa doesn't respond while it's playing
