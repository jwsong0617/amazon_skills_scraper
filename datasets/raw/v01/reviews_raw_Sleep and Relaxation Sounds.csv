Muse,2,"This is a decent skill to enable for Echo. Upon opening up you can ask Echo to list the sounds however she reads them so fast it can be difficult to keep track. I've compiled that full list below as of March 17, 2017. This skill needs some work as once you open it you need to issue it the direct name of the sound you want immediately it asks ""What can I do for you?"". Otherwise it will look for a band by that name to shuffle music for. It also does not really have the capability to switch between sounds, you will need to tell Echo to open sleep sounds each time and name the sound you wish to switch to.List of Sounds:Beautiful Dream - Electronic piano music, soft, slow and slightly sad. Personally I enjoyed this sound.Brown Noise - Sounds like you're sitting next to an industrial intake fanCity Rain - Moderate steady rain with slight drips on pavementHeartbeat - Plays a heartbeat at approximately 80 bpm with slight tempo variationsHeavy Rain - Sounds more like loud static white noiseJungle Night - Crickets, birds, insects, and some other wild animals. One of my favorites.Mountain Lake - Lapping water that sounds like waves from the wake of a boat. Cuts in and out.Ocean - Moderate wave sounds, slight white noise quality to backgroundRain - Sounds like 'City Rain'Relax -RiverSleep Little BabiesSmall LakeSwish MassageThunderstormWhite NoiseWind ChimesRainforestFireplace - Fast fireplace crackle, short loop that cuts in and out.UnderwaterWindMusic BoxForest Birds","on March 17, 2017",b419b532-d9c5-47ec-b4b1-7c97eea8fb44,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381085.249983,Decent Sounds,189 people found this helpful.

Darren,0,"This is a great app that is useful for sleep, but also for background sounds when studying, writing, or reading. Really you can use it for anything. I've had the birds playing while cleaning the house instead of music. It's a nice change. If you want to use the timer function, try saying ""end"" instead of ""stop"" like the instructions say. For example, once it's playing, say, ""Alexa, end in 30 minutes."" Echo will reply with something along the lines of a sleep timer set for 30 minutes.","on April 9, 2017",635cbb22-0890-403f-8ee5-a93845a335cb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381085.292515,Use it for more than just sleep time,45 people found this helpful.
R. Seehoffer,6,"I've used this app for over a month to help me sleep and it has been wonderful until last night. The sound is now stopping after less than an hour and needs to be manually resumed for it to continue. I must have done that a half a dozen times last night. I disabled and re-enabled the app and that didn't help. I'm not sure what changed but obviously in my case I can't use it like this. Prior to this issue, the sound would fade out after about an hour and fade back in a few seconds. That wasn't bad because it wasn't distractful. But, now it just stops.Update--The Dev., Jeff, has been very responsive and has come up with a solution to the problem, which was apparently triggered by some Amazon change. It is working now--much appreciated!","on May 18, 2017",b58f320b-739f-46fe-9fe8-33e632e6ad24,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381085.382415,Sound now cutting off after less than an hour (Now fixed),30 people found this helpful.
mayfayre,0,"The sound loops are done seamlessly on this skill, and the sounds are very relaxing.  They work well to calm a busy mind that is supposed to be going to sleep but can't. I've listened to a lot of sleep sound programs over the years because I like them for relaxation, so I know the difference between those that induce relaxation and those that are inadvertently ""too busy"", or which aren't looped smoothly, and become annoying instead. This skill is one of the good ones and I recommend it.","on March 11, 2017",77219524-40dc-40d2-8b0a-04cb73b84636,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381085.403627,Well-Made Skill That Does As Advertised!,30 people found this helpful.
Lawrence Raybon,0,"So I have been enjoying this app and it has helped me get more restful sleep.  I was a little miffed when suddenly they decided to put most of their content behind a paywall.  It even says the original content would be free to the original users but nevertheless I get the message that the sound I have been listening to for weeks is now premium only.  Well I decide the promotional lifetime membership is worth it so I shell out the fifteen bucks and follow the instructions to register.  But then nothing happened.  I'm out $15 and don't even get what I paid for!  Used to be a good app and would even be worth the money, but as is it is a total rip off.  Will be emailing the developer for a refund.  If that doesn't work I'll be complaining to Amazon as it reflects poorly on them as well.

Kelsey,0,"I CANNOT sleep without a fan. Mine broke the other night and I had the worst time falling and staying asleep. With my work schedule I wouldn't be able to get a new fan for a few days, and I can't go that long without a good nights sleep! My boyfriend suggested having Alexa play beach noises, to which I begrudgingly agreed (I'm picky about my pre sleep white noise, okay?!).Once I downloaded the skill, Alexa offered to go through the full FORTY list of sounds! 40!! And it's not your typical sappy nature noises. I was over the moon when she mentioned oscillating fan. It was super relaxing, and the way the sound fades in and out it actually sounds like a natural fan sweeping back and forth. I woke up at one point in the morning actually expecting to feel a cool breeze on my face as Alexa imitated the sound of a fan turning in my direction.I will still be picking up a fan as we're mid summer and I need something to move air around my room at night. However this will be great come winter when I need white noise but don't need something adding chill to the air.","on July 8, 2017",e079901d-df89-4f3c-9278-d74b90eba95d,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381085.4429388,I need a fan on to sleep,11 people found this helpful.

Wannabme,1,"UPDATED REVIEW:In my previous review, I wrote that ""I deleted it"" because it was ""limited in what you can have played."" But since then, I received feedback from the developer(s). Basically, the developer stated that there are many sounds to try and that the app is not limited. So I downloaded the app again and gave it another try. This is my second opinion of the app.Yes, there are many different sleep sounds, but most of them are not free. However, I believe that a free Sample of the sounds are available for purchase because today, when I downloaded the app again, I was able to hear some sounds that are not free.Another problem that I've encountered is that when I asked the Echo device to change to another sound, she misunderstood my request and began to play a song from the Amazon music library (or store, since I do not have a music library with Amazon). In this case, I had to ask the Echo device to stop, and then ask the Echo device to go back to the Sleep and Relaxation Sounds app and start over again. I'm not sure what I was doing wrong, if anything.The bottom line is the app is good, but if you want more sounds than the app has to offer for free, you have to purchase them. I hope this updated review is helpful. Thank you.","on August 22, 2017",e2426426-1f1d-4e01-b167-07309457f3a3,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381085.498964,My Updated Review,9 people found this helpful.

Gary Fisher,0,"The Sleep Sound skill is a wonderful example of the versatility of the Amazon Echo; comparing Alexa with Sleep Sounds to devices which do only this one thing, this skill could by itself justify purchasing an Echo. With dozens of superbly recorded sounds ranging from Distant Train to Mountain Lake, Sleep Sounds provides an aural background free of annoying skips or obvious repeats as the tranquil audio samples weave themselves into the room environment. While Sleep Sounds is superbly suited to bedroom use, the quality and variety of sounds could also make it useful in many other settings; an Echo Dot tucked discretely among a grouping of plants, quietly playing the Forest Birds skill, could transform a sterile lobby into a welcoming waiting room. Highly recommended.","on May 16, 2017",1d1cdb0a-1941-411e-a5de-35537f4a1d0f,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381091.303284,Very Well Done,9 people found this helpful.

Patrick Brown,1,"I'm a new dad with twin infants and this skill was initially amazing for getting them to quiet down during feeding times. It was pretty simple: ""Open Sleep Sounds"", ""Play [Whatever I felt like in the moment.]But lately, there's about a 1 in 3 chance I will say ""Open Sleep Sounds"" and will be greeted with a five to ten minute monologue about new features (that doesn't actually enhance the experience I was already receiving), a tutorial on how to use a skill I've already been a steady or loyal user for several months, or (infuriatingly) a request that I navigate to this page to rate Sleep Sounds. Well, the coincidence of this request in the context of me trying to sooth a teething infant while Alexa's voice waking up the other twin is exactly what motivated me.The Sleep Sounds skill's competitors aren't just other white noise skills on the Alexa, but playlists I could easily generate from Spotify or Amazon Music. Or a cheap noise generator. Or a radio tuned in between stations. Or even a box fan or hair dryer. So it's a case of constantly attempting to ""improve"" the product actually gets in the way of the usefulness of the product when it's just as easy for me to never invoke it all if it doesn't work as expected.Perhaps if Invoked Apps did more to engage their users OUTSIDE of the Alexa... such as through social media or reaching out through Amazon's registered users, instead of making me wade through an interaction to actually get to the use case I want from it (basically... static).I have disabled the skill on Alexa and instead ordered a white noise machine for the living room. Is it hands free like the Sleep Sounds skill? No. Does it work basically the same way every time and doesn't blast me with product updates at 4 AM when I'm half asleep and my kids are fussy? No. And that alone makes it worth the money.","on August 11, 2017",a5a4c243-0c96-4342-9d81-d415cd0ff1cc,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381091.4082088,"Good Skill.

John Stuchal,0,"With 40 different sound effects to choose from, it is worth the price of Alexa just to use this.  You can control the volu MN e, and there is no break in the loop when playing.  If you have more then one Alexa, you can have multiple rooms playing, which is relaxing while working or if there is distracting background sounds.  This is also great to use if you have a dog that barks when he hears outdoor sounds.  Just choose a sound effect that has low sound tones.  This is based on scientific rrsearch too, when reading about preventing dog barking.","on June 11, 2017",5c83dbce-d86a-4d69-b018-106f6a541e6f,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381091.42911,As good as any retail sleep machine.,5 people found this helpful.
Stefan Harkins,0,"I can't recommend this particular skill highly enough. It makes almost every other ambient or relaxation sounds skill obsolete by featuring over 40 different ambient sounds within its own skill, such as: whales, Native American flute, cicadas, jungle night, wind chimes, and Sleep Little Babies (which was more of a soft classical music that I really enjoyed, so I believe it could be titled better!) which are some of my favorites!  I can't wait to see what they offer next, I would be willing to donate to support this skill. It's an all in one relaxation station!  I would also like to suggest that in the future they add more sounds, such as: New Age music, metronome, classical piano, harp, and dolphins (or dolphins and whales!).","on June 25, 2017",76350529-2364-4cec-81ae-df908ad00f54,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381091.463377,Makes Every Other Ambient Sound Skill Obsol,3 people found this helpful.

Doug Barnhart,0,"I was caught off guard when I said ""Alexa, open sleep sounds"".  Instead of getting the familiar ""Welcome back, what can I do for you?"", Alexa says, ""Would you do me a favor?""  I am paraphrasing here.  ""Would you take a few moments to give me a five star rating and write a review?""  She then goes into a rather lengthy explanation of the steps required to do it,  Since she said please, and asked very nicely, as a model to my kids I am complying with her request.  I am curious if Alexa will be checking up on me.  If I was to leave a 3 or 4 star rating, would she chastise me?  Since I did what she asked, is she smart enough to know not to ask me this again? I wonder if my AI companion will continue to ask me to do favors for her?  Does she have a sinister agenda, and will lead me down a dark and nefarious path, with her subtle suggestions?  She knows everything about me,  She listens to every word I say.  So I finish my review with, ""Yes Alexa I followed your command.

Otherwise its likely Alexa will try to play you sonething else with the same name, like a sample of an album.I am hoping for more sounds.  Two that are sorely missing are Spring Peepers, and Summer Night with tree frogs. My two favorites.

I really like that I got in on the lifetime membership for one fee. I use this app it daily so it will absolutely pay off over time. For a long time I use my iPhone and many different apps to do what this app does. The only problem with the iPhone is that some of the app developers discontinue the version that I paid for and create a new app- then if you want to have the sounds back you must purchase the app all over again.  Then there are other apps abandoned by the develper are no longer supported and do not work on updated operating systems. I am confident that this will not be the case with sleep relaxation sounds.","on August 27, 2017",25183b85-60d1-4fc2-8293-81a302110587,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381133.383329,LOVE PREMIUM,2 people found this helpful.

Dennis M. Wierzbicki,0,"At first, I was very excited to use my bedside Echo Dot (connected to a Tivoli radio) to replace my Sleep Machine app I've been using for years. This would allow me to place my iPhone in standby at night, and would also allow me to use the Echo upon awakening (with the Sleep Machine, the noise drowns out the Echo's microphones).I enabled the skill, and went to sleep, and all was well...until 2 hours had passed, and the sounds suddenly stopped...then started again. I am a light sleeper, which is one of the reasons why I need a background sound to sleep more soundly, so when the sound goes away, I jolt awake. Since the sound quickly resumed, I soon was back asleep...only to be jolted awake once more in two hours. I quickly understood what was happening, and got up, disabled the Sleep and Relaxation sounds, and went back to my iPhone app system.Can't you make this so it loops WITHOUT STOPPING BETWEEN LOOPS? If not, it's of no use to me.","on June 10, 2017",a5060452-6940-4fb9-aa67-c7655e7cf845,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381145.254535,"Stops and goes silent every two hours before resuming, and this wakes me up.",2 people found this helpful.

Amazon Customer,0,"my husband and I use this every single night. I cannot sleep without it. We recently started using distant thunder and it's exactly like listening to a thunderstorm roll in.

It drives me crazy.  Very unnatural and even though I know what's going on I still get startled by this and wonder if it shut down or the battery ran down.

DRRamirez,0,"Listening to ""Train Ride"" reminds me of a favorite Hitchcock film, ""The Lady Vanishes"". The films main setting takes place on a train where a female character vanishes under suspicious circumstances. It feels as though you really are on a train ride and are a passenger with a ""cat bird seat"" view. Every night I play this sleep sound and I envision myself on a train ride that takes me away -- almost vanishing in to sleep.This skill set is an amazing skill set for Alexa; adding sleep sounds helps allieviate anxiety and provide the mind with constant white noise to facilitate a good nights rest. One good feature to point out is that the sound plays continuously until you request it to stop -- no time limit as with YouTube.Please keep supporting this app and let the creators know this skill set is a wonderful addition in the aid for mental tranquility.","on June 6, 2017",0d636e7e-9db6-4f48-a8cb-c8e5ce61cac0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381174.988856,The Man Vanishes,3 people found this helpful.

At first I can interrupt to ask what time it is or give commands for more or less volume, play a different sound, tell it to ""stop"" etc. but after a couple of commands, Alexa ignores me no matter what I say. Then I have to get out of bed and physically turn the unit off and restart it which is very frustrating if I'm trying to relax.","on March 21, 2017",a77d346d-4c76-44e0-8ab9-f1e6079fd028,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381192.665077,It Works Well . . .

Meri,1,"Was just playing around with the sounds to see which one would work best for me and then I was totally creeped out. I selected Heavy Rain and instead I got this Blaire Witch type whispery voice talking about something I could barely understand between the raspy tone and my brain being focused on getting as far from the origin of the poltergeist voice that had taken over my Alexa. Once the rain started and my adrenaline dissipated it was alright but given that the intention of selecting a sound ment for relaxing immediately became an internal struggle to not wet myself from fear or have a heart attack, I think I'll try to get my rain sounds from a less haunted place.","on July 23, 2017",a2204e17-095d-4b24-81ca-b86e6a94021f,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sleep and Relaxation Sounds,1504381964.675849,That was more creepy than a horror movie!!,2 people found this helpful.
