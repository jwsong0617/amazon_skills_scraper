David in Dallas,0,"Hearing all the fuss about Fox News caused me to try them out for myself.  As a loyal ""CNN-ist"" for 20+ years, I didn't think I'd be impressed.  What I discovered was that Fox News really is the only NEWS organization left that presents both sides of any given position.I'm apolitical and just don't do politics. Unfortunately however, it seems CNN, NPR, and the TV networks' news divisions have all become political advocates, instead of journalists. If I desire advocacy, I can find any number of websites that suit any political point of view. I enjoy Fox News' NEWScasts however, because they present information about the world and give me the facts, without all the advocacy from the anchor.Of course they have commentary segments/shows, and all the commentators (different from anchors), on Fox News are conservatives.  During their actual NEWScasts however, it's refreshing to hear news anchors present NEWS to me in a balanced fashion, allowing me to take it for what it is (INFORMATION), without all the political spin or political advocacy that seems to have infiltrated all the other ""news"" organizations.  I think I've found a new news home.","on December 6, 2016",43569816-73c1-4737-a092-fbc5d0084c26,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fox News,1504378948.1120799,New to Fox News...

Today's reporters try to slant the news or even create their own stories to control people's opinions and ideas.

The only problem was that so many folks reviewed the skill giving it just one star! Can you imagine? One star! Folks complained that I talk too fast; but there was no way for Matthew to adjust my speaking speed. Another complaint was that the pronouns were wrong for the name even though Matthew programmed 3000 boy's names and 4000 girl's names. Matthew decided to write many different stories for folks to play and hoped they would give his skill a bunch of stars. Well now you know my story. Since it is getting late, you may listen to one more Short Bedtime Story and if it's OK with your dad, you may have a cookie with milk before bed.","on February 2, 2017",e96336ee-caf9-4530-81fb-6bbffae594c9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Short Bedtime Story,1504379272.440784,Love the skill and rant - 5 Stars as requested!!!,16 people found this helpful.

Nate S,1,"This has the potential to be one of the greatest skills for those with toddlers.  Great funny stories that involve the child by name and hilarious and encouraging closing statements.However, there currently seems to only be about 10-15 stories available so repeats happen fairly quickly.  Also, a few of them are not ideal for younger kids that deal with zombies or that the toddler is an evil witch.  You can always have Alexa stop and then do again, but really these should be removed.  It's also sometimes tough to get Alexa to launch properly for some reason.Lots of potential though, just needs some tweaks and more stories to be added.  Perhaps the developer is willing to accept submissions (assuming they are carefully manually reviewed before being added), that would allow for a ton of new stories fairly quickly!!!","on January 6, 2017",4c9b9f0f-db67-4345-9481-5df807c07b73,4.0 out of 5 stars,Short Bedtime Story,1504379278.6291258,"With a few tweaks and the addition of lots of new stories, CROWD SOURCE THIS (with evaluation), this has lots of potential!!!",22 people found this helpful.

It kept her busy for about 10 minutes before I stopped it. Same effect every time. NOTE to those who say it only meows once, you have to engage in a conversation. Each time Alexa meows, you have to meow back.  Use several meows in a row and you'll often get a longer reply. Vary the length as if you are conducting a conversation. Sometimes my cat will conduct the conversation by herself so I just watch and smile!Your cat will love it.","on January 23, 2017",55b1af5b-233f-4bed-a732-2029a94ca06c,5.0 out of 5 stars,Meow!,1504379771.8321788,My vocal cat loves it,6 people found this helpful.

Just e-mail them.But here's a few tricks I've found.1:  Alexa wants to hear commands in a certain way.  The most important thing is to use the following syntax:""Alexa: Tell Anymote TO xxx MY yyy""Where xxx is the remote control button name, and yyy is the remote name.The words TO and MY are VERY important.2: Alexa is learning new words everyday.  But just as Alexa sometimes doesn't catch what you say just right under normal circumstances, the same can be true using this skill.  For example, I have an A/V switcher with buttons normally named A1..A2..A3..B1..B2 etc.  But Alexa doesn't understand those as words and will send Command ""undefined."" to the app.  But in the Anymote app. you can rename any button name - just click on the pencil edit icon for your remote, click on EDIT, highlight the button you want to rename, and click on tT (text) in the upper left.  This will show you the DEFAULT button name.  This is what you must use in your command to Alexa (""xxx"" in my first trick above) - but you can change it.  So in my example, change A1 to DVR and you  will see the command is translated and will work properly.*** When first starting out you should use the edit feature in the app. to see EXACTLY what the buttons names are, and say them to Alexa just as they are shown in my TIP # 1 above.3: Just because a command is translated and shows up on your smart device doesn't mean it will work unless the button name and remote name are translated exactly correct.  So Alexa will translate to your smart device Received voice command ""volume up"" for remote ""Television"" - but if your button is not named ""Volume UP"" it won't do anything.  Likewise if you don't have a remote named ""Television"".So in short, name your remote and button names (which you can change in the app.) with words Alexa will always translate properly and you will solve 99% of the issues.The really neat thing is the app doesn't have to be launched on your smart device.  If you have an Anymote Home (which I HIGHLY recommend, available on Amazon) IR blaster/recorder, just make sure bluetooth is turned on (you DO NOT need to connect bluetooth, that happens automatically).And make sure you have WIFI or a network connection to your Amazon Echo.With the well over 1,250,000 remote device configurations available in the app. and easy to match to your devices, and the record capability for just about any remote you have, you'll be able to control just about anything with Alexa voice commands with this skill.","on December 11, 2015",51dd3ad8-40f5-4ac6-8780-b77770bf9cfb,5.0 out of 5 stars,AnyMote Smart Remote,1504379868.783145,MUST READ TIPS FOR THE ANYMOTE SMART REMOTE SKILL,34 people found this helpful.

robert evans,0,"Started setting up remotes on my iphone 6s using anymote app.  The cable and sound bar worked, but it couldn't find the right remote for my smart TV. I had to use a generic one.  After setting up remotes, I notice that after exiting the anymote app and going back in to use the remotes, there are connection issues between anymote and my phone.  I would go into view bluetooth devices on my phone and anymote would not be there.  It seems to do this about 85% of the time.  Programming of buttons using the record method also does not work. My phone kept loosing connection to anymote and when I finally was able to connect, pointing the tv remote at anymote and pressing the command I want to program often did nothing.  If I finally get it to take the command, it does not work when trying to use it.  I was able to get alexa accept macro commands.  Alexa sends command but devices do nothing. I spend more time trying to get anymote and alexa to work than I would searching for the remotes to power on the TV, cable box and sound bar.

E. Wrye,0,"THIS IS A REVIEW SPECIFICALLY OF USING IT WITH AMAZON ECHO VOICE CONTROL ONLY: In its current state this is more of a novelty than a practical application. First off, the long phrase you must speak to initiate an action makes you feel kinda stupid when pushing one button could accomplish the same thing. Secondly, rather than sending the whole phrase over to Anymote then having Anymote parse the command words and figure out what you want, this had the Echo do the parsing and just send what it THINKS the command is over to the remote it THINKS you said. This not only requires you to choose super simple limited one word device names but the Echo doesn't understand many command words that it would have no problem understanding in other context. Also, Echo has an issue with compound words or phrases and will most often only send one word. Examples: ""Tell Anymote to Volume up 5 times my receiver"" ALWAYS makes echo only send volume up so Anymote volumes up once. ""Tell Anymote to Initiate my Samsung"" where ""initiate"" is a button you created for a macro to turn on your entertainment system results in echo either telling you it doesn't understand the command or giving you an example of what you can say with Anymote. Many words result in this - I went through 4 or 5 words renaming the button before finally finding one that echo would properly send over to Anymote. ""Tell Anymote to Movie Mode my Receiver"" will 3 out of 4 times cause echo to send only ""movie"" and not ""movie mode"" - this is typical with all compound words or any command phrase more than one word - echo will most often only send one word. Overall, this doesn't work well enough or reliably enough to be used for anything other than a novelty or something to play around with for kicks and giggles. Hopefully the developers will come up with simpler phrasing for the command and also just have echo send the entire command over and have their app parse the words and figure out what to do (hopefully with better algorithms). I know this would require way more programming but would add significant value to the Anymote app.","on January 8, 2016",a6c48ab7-e9ab-4387-a0b2-6d5e1bf5d0b5,2.0 out of 5 stars,AnyMote Smart Remote,1504379868.851768,ECHO Review: More Novelty than Usefulness Now,14 people found this helpful.

I ask Alexa to either set scene concentrate in bedroom, or turn on scene concentrate in bedroom, or turn on my group that holds the scene. Nothing works.

Geekin,0,"The hue bridge stores a really long name for each scene based on room. So you may have 5 ""devices"" they show up something like this: bathroom offlinebathroom dimmed bathroom brightBathroom spring blossom sceneBathroom bedtime sceneBecause I have 5 entries that say bathroom alexa has no idea what im talking about when i ask her to turn the bathroom on or off. Some people are blaming Alexa for this. I actually blame Hue. If i have 5 light bulbs in my house hue shouldnt be claiming itself as 40 devices on my network. (Which it does every time i scan for smart devices)The way i got around this: deleted all rooms in my hue app and put a letter next to each light name (ceiling light b for bedroom) then i used the clean up feature in the hue app. After that i went into the alexa app and told it to refresh devices then forget every but the lights i created. After that i set up my ""rooms"" by using alexas groups. Now i can tell her to turn on/off specific rooms.This workaround is okish for me but if i had other devices using hue or a ton of the color lights in my house i would have more trouble and more groups to create. Hue really needs to sit down and reconfi this.

Jeffrey Scott,1,"Ok folks.  I too have struggled with the inability to command Alexa to access my scenes.  I read all of the things that others wrote to guarantee our success.  I had to believe that since others have figured out how to make it work, I could also figure it out.  Certainly the technology gods are not arbitrarily deciding who gets to control scenes with their voices.  Today was the day!  Before you think I'm smart, I must admit it was an accident.I had my one room set up in Hue (3 fixtures).  I had a couple of scenes that I made and a couple of premade scenes that I kept.  Deleted the rest of the premade scenes.  My custom scenes have boring names like ""blue"" and ""pink"" and ""normal"".I probably spent a couple hours over the past week trying to figure this out.  Forgot and discovered my fixtures about 10 times with no success.  Well today I had to change out my powerstrip so I had to unplug Alexa.  Once I plugged it in again, the scenes worked!!I'm not trying to say that this is the absolute fix (it can't be that easy), but all I did was unplug everything and plug it back in again.  To quote a wise I.T. tech, ""Did you try turning it off and on again?""Now I can shout, ""Alexa! turn on BLUE"" and the lights obey.I hope this works for you too :)","on January 2, 2017",2237f770-f1bd-49fd-a502-8cbd0e9b124a,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hue,1504379968.0547369,Huzzah!!!,13 people found this helpful.

Garion,1,"Once I understood how to set this up and what to say it works fine.  Make sure your Hue bridge and app is working fine and all of the lights and rooms are working.  If you have color bulbs mess with that too to make sure they are working and scenes work from the Hue app.  Then enable the Hue skill in the skills section of the Alexa App.  Then go to the Smart Home section and discover devices. THIS IS IMPORTANT! If you already have devices showing in your app then disable the Hue skill and remove the devices.  Then enable the skill and re-discover the devices.  I send the command this way Alexa Turn On (scene name) in (room name). Example: Alexa Turn On Arctic Aurora in Bedroom,  Alexa Turn On Reading in Living Room.  Please note: I cannot find a way to send a scene to an individual bulb in rooms that have multiple bulbs.  Things like Alexa Turn On Energize in Bedroom1 does not work (I have 3 lights in the bedroom). It only works in rooms.  I am still looking to find a way to turn off the other two lights off while turning a bedside lamp to reading without giving multiple commands. I am sure it is out there just haven't found it yet.

Lauren,1,"*Review of functionality of app belowIn app seemed to be giving me similar problems that others have stated having: not getting verification text promptly, and unable to get beyond giving my cc info (error message of ""unexpected error"" would pop up and that would be the end of it). I use Lyft to get to work constantly as I am always on call, usually only get about an hour's notice, and live close enough that it's not a huge expense to use it to at least get to work so I'm not sweaty and wind blown by the time I get there. So needless to say I wasn't opposed to doing a little detective work to get it to work, scrolled down through the comments until I finally found someone who, instead of belittling those who could not figure out how to link their account and therefore gave a bad review, actually gave a useful solution.Got out the laptop, amazon.com, departments drop down, Echo & Alexa, Alexa skills, search Lyft, link account. At this point you will have to allow the pop up that amazon is going to want to open as the ""sign in to Lyft"" page, so if you have an adblocker, you should get a little notification when you click ""link account"", which will give you the option to allow it. But I mean, if you had the wherewithal to install an adblocker, I'd imagine you'd already be privy to how to temporarily disable it/allow a one time pop up window. After that, it's just like how it wanted to work in the app, send verification text, give cc info, hit accept, account linked!*As to how well the function actually works, I tried it out and I'm as pleased as could be. I asked, ""Alexa, I need a ride from Lyft"" (you have to specify Lyft as those dirty b*stards at Uber cornered the ""I need a ride"" phrase for their app), and she informed how far away in minutes the closest driver was to my location, then asked if I'd like her to call it for me. If yes, she'll play a bit of music (seems to change every time) until you're paired. It seems that at this point the music will stop, at which point I usually get a text from the Lyft app about my driver, but Alexa will also ask if I'd like to know if the app has successfully paired me with anyone so I don't have to worry about checking it on my phone. If you say yes, she'll give you the appropriate info about the driver like name, type of car, and eta (basically the information that you get via text from Lyft). Definitely great for me when I'm scrambling to get my sh*t together, get it all together, and put it in a backpack. All my sh*t, so it's all together.","on January 8, 2017",9a5a9071-eca8-497b-899f-73fcd0254530,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lyft,1504379984.5720289,Can't link account in app?
