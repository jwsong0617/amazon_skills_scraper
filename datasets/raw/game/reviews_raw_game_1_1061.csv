Amazon Customer,0,"So you may know me as xXx69FidgetSpinnerPro69xXx on the web, I used to make clickbaity youtube videos with fake fidget spinner giveaways back in the day. One day however I stopped, and disappeared from the web entirely, that's because I discovered this skill, I assure you that this is much better than an actual fidget spinner, more fun and addictive. This app also helped me become one and find peace, with this app I started my fidget spinner pilgrimage where I would spend days with the door to my room locked, my parents, after much crying started to slide me food under the door. Every time I got a plate I made sure to spin it in prayer to the fidget god before eating. The only other thing I did was play Fidget spinner using the amazon dot, just me and Alexa. However last night I had a dream, where the god of fidget taught me how to make a iphone out of dead rats and plates so that I could rate this game and spread my the love of fidget!FIDGET BLESS YOU","on September 3, 2017",f5c268f4-1313-4e80-a78c-3da3aaa7b9ed,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fidget Spinner,1504520710,This skill allowed me to start my fidget spinner pilgrimage.,0

The adventures are quite short, but each paints a fun picture with Alexa's text to speech and creative use of question and response.  Though simple, there are even some sound effects creatively used to enhance the stories.

Kelly Ness,0,"I like this skill. Reminds me of the text based MUDs and adventure games from my college days. I think it's frustrating that once you get on a certain path or sequence in most of the adventure you can't go back to the last ""room"" or area. Often you have to finish the mini adventure before you get an option to just go back to the starting area and go from there. Another frustrating thing is there are often multiple choices for movement or actions but choosing differently only adds steps to the adventure instead of changing the outcome or location you end up on. Other than these things, which could be easily improved, I've had a great time exploring this game and hope more areas and adventures are added in the future. And to those saying only little kids would like this...

AwesomeSauce,0,"I never thought a choose your own adventure type game would keep me so entertained. This one sure has. If you've never played one it's a little like the idea of Dungeons and Dragons but without dice. You choose which path to take in the forrest. One way may kill you (or actually send you to the restart area), another way will lead you to a room that you need an artifact from, like a key.Cons: it can be a little for frustrating finding the exact word it wants to complete an action. It's usually exactly what it asked if you wanted to do but sometimes you have to experiment. Also, waiting for more content. It seems i've caught up with what the game developers have written so far, in a week or so they'll have the next section done.Pros: Hours of entertainment.","on August 29, 2016",9a4de20d-8ca9-45e5-9fba-f7fc6ffc24ac,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Magic Door,1504520733,Oooh so much fun,7 people found this helpful.

I was a little bummed the bronze key is no longer needed ( I did find it). I like games that make you unlock things to progress. It also helps someone who just starts to steer them in the right direction so they done get stuck in an area that they don't have equipment or haven't figured out how the game works (i.e. do actions that Alexa doesn't list) Great puzzles and great game can't wait to the next part of the journey goes live.","on January 7, 2017",fb231e1c-48f5-4826-b221-d0f8a375049d,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Magic Door,1504520762,Fun stories with different difficulty levels,5 people found this helpful.

Mel,0,"Tried this out with my 7 year old son.. it's a good start, but could definitely be better:The first choice allows you to pick from 3 paths. After that, most of the choices aren't really choices that move the story forward - mostly just keep going or go back. Later on you get more choices, but these just give you more information about the scenery and you can basically eventually choose all options. Sometimes she asks you what you want to do without giving you options - we found that if this happens you can say ""what are my choices?"" and she'll tell you.Having Alexa tell a story - especially a story - is a bit boring since there is no emotion to her voice. They do have some sound clips to add to it, but would be better if they recorded this with a voice with inflection and feeling.Basically it was a really long not overly interesting ""adventure"" that we didn't even finish because she randomly turned herself off.I might try a different path on a different day to see if it's any more interesting, but so far I'm not impressed.","on December 26, 2016",16a53699-170f-471e-841b-b4c135cfb058,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Magic Door,1504520856,meh,6 people found this helpful.

PATOLA,0,"This will be a great concept once it is expanded upon. As of now it's lacking a bit.Specific examples:1. Alexa just speaks - she doesn't tell a story. For example Alexa says ""Bur"" instead saying saying ""Burrrr"" with any emotion. The good thing is the characters encountered during the story speak in a very animated way.2. When choosing an option we got stuck in a circle and had to choose a different option to get out of the circle.3.

Michael Sturrock,0,"The time I spent ?úthrough the magic door??were unquestionably the most wasteful eight minutes of my existence to date. This applet is a blatant a pitiable attempt to stuff features into the Amazon Echo which, unless you have a spare million pounds for a compatible voice-controlled toaster, is only useful for music (assuming you have Spotify).From the moment Alexa beckoned me through the ?úmagic??door and the manufactured door-hinge squeak noise sounded, I was sceptical. Even Alexa has Any film or scenario to date that has included a manufactured door hinge squeak has lacked any originally or plot depth. At least Alexa?ôs robotic storytelling matched my levels of charisma.I can?ôt remember what happened shortly after entering the door, but soon enough I came ?úface to face??with a small detestable rabbit. The rabbit talked at some length about trivial and annoying things, which was made more annoying by the fact the rabbit informed us that we were late for the princess??party (to which he also was going).I don?ôt know why he would continue to talk if he knew we were all going to be late.The Rabbit proposed that to get there quicker, we could ?útake our chances with the troll??who may lend us his horse. I thought this was an odd way to talk about someone who apparently had a large enough capacity for generosity to lend a complete stranger use of his horse. Upon engaging with the troll, it immediately began to violently pursue me. At this point, it became clear that the little cretinous rabbit knew all along that the troll was going to be uncooperative. When I think back to what the rabbit said, its tone of voice was clearly laced with a level of deceit and malice only possessed by the most evil woodland creatures.Luckily, the story can be ended by a firm yank of the power chord in the opposite direction of the amazon echo.

Alexandra,0,"This game is ok when it works but a lot of the time, it doesn't. Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about:1) Sometimes when you tell the game to repeat a clue, it will respond with ""please answer yes or no"" and then it will beep to tell you that you got the question wrong before you even answered.2) The game will sometimes tell you that your answer is wrong, even though it's actually correct (see the photo attached to this review -- it is a screenshot from my phone of the voice history for my Echo). You can see that I answered the question correctly, even verbatim, but the game still told me it was wrong. Please note that the ""category"" text in between what the game said is the correct answer and my answer was actually for the question afterwards.3) Sometimes, you cannot understand what the clue is asking for. This is due to a mixture of a lack of proper inflection from the Echo and very poorly worded clues.Honestly, this game is just another example of an app that was rushed into existence with very little quality control (and the fact that it has not gotten any better over time leads me to believe that it's not actively developed).Overall, it's fun to play here and there but it can be very frustrating when it doesn't work as expected (which is quite often).","on July 5, 2016",13e258e1-1c67-4b93-b6b4-f03efff6b0da,1.0 out of 5 stars,Jeopardy!,1504521035,Very Poor App,29 people found this helpful.

Tim Brown,0,"It's OK; I play it while washing dishes or cooking.  I'd give it 5 stars but for the following. Much of the time, I cannot understand what Alexa's pronunciation. She asks a question about berries and my wife an I look at each other and say ""I thought she said 'bears'"".  Other times, again because we don't have the benefit of reading the question on a screen like in the TV show, we get confused by homonyms: ""Known for their Razrs, this company... made the first... in 1984"".  Yes motorola makes Razrs, but they do not make razors.  Alex Trebek (or my own eyes) would have somehow indicated that Razr is spelled differently, Alexa did not. I guessed ""Gillette"". Perhaps different wording should have been used to clarify.  The communication breakdown goes both ways; sometimes when you ask Alexa to repeat the question by saying ""repeat"" she tells you that is wrong.  So much for bears / berries.  Other times she misses the correct answer entirely: ""what is a camel?"".  ""No, sorry, that is incorrect.  The correct answer is 'what is a camel'"".

Amanda,0,"I love this game. I look forward to it every night, but it could use some improvements for a truly flawless experience. First off, the sound is WAY too sensitive. If someone across the house even whispers, it records their voice and you get marked wrong. Same issue with the TV even. (But when someone says ""Alexa"" on a commercial she can't pick that up?) Second, It will not recognize ""repeat"" and marks a wrong answer. Last, it will just shut off after an answer is given.

littleredheadedgirl,0,"There seems to be a glitch. When I go back and look at the transcription, it lists the answers to previous questions. Which I'm guessing is why it's telling me I'm wrong when I'm right. There's nothing quite so infuriating as getting the answers right and being told that they are incorrect. Also it often just hears incorrectly. Like, REALLY incorrectly. Like I said Oprah and it thought I said Red.... One answer I gave was David, when I checked it said I had answered Lincoln.... I had answered Lincoln for a different question the last time I played four days ago? If this wasn't so glitchy I would give it five stars.

S. Johnson,1,"So anybody who has an Alexa knows that she doesn't always hear well. Jeopardy comes with a ""did she hear you correctly?"" type feedback section that shows the question and what she heard. Except here's the problem: the answers aren't on the right freaking question!!! And inevitably there is one missing. How can you give proper feedback if the whole thing is a convoluted mess? Also, if you say ANYTHING other than ""repeat"" on the questions that you need to hear twice because a robot's inflection/pronunciation isn't always correct, it'll automatically count it wrong. So no ""um"", ""uh"", or ""huh?"" muttered to yourself before you say repeat. Even when you look in the app later and it actually does hear ""uh...repeat"" it doesn't recognize that as a command but as an answer.","on March 21, 2017",31aa051f-f304-4605-99b6-1f61553f1819,3.0 out of 5 stars,Jeopardy!,1504521047,"HORRIBLE ""feedback"" in Ap",2 people found this helpful.

Just a few comments: Like  other reviewers reported, Alexa will sometimes say you are wrong when you've clearly given the right answer. This is extremely frustrating, I wonder if the Amazon techs are using this skill to aid improvements in voice recognition? Second, how are weekly stats compiled? Does it favor  the everyday player? I invariably score in the top 1% on a weekly basis, My daily scores more in the 5-20% range.

Mila,0,Like many other apps designed as a skill to work with Alexa I find it very interesting but these particular skills need further development. I tell it to play Jeopardy it gives me six questions and then when the round is over I play Jeopardy again and it repeats the same 6 questions identically which I think is a little ridiculous. Not only is it embarrassing should that occur in front of other people to the Alexa brand itself for others wanting to obtain Alexa perhaps not necessarily for this particular skill but when showing off a product and seeing its capabilities alongside friends and family stumbling across the skill and then using it one person gets to play then another person tries and he hears repeated questions is quite funny. I think the skill is awesome but you guys seriously need to add a little bit of intelligence to the skill so it doesn't repeat identical questions and obviously add many more questions to the capabilities of the skill. I don't know why you guys developed and release this app in the way that are currently is the only thing I can think of is that you guys were planning to provide weekly updates instead of daily updates to this skill so that once a week people can play Jeopardy however it still raises the question multiple people in the same house or the same place using Alexa and multiple people playing Jeopardy it still wouldn't make sense.

I.F.,2,"This app has guessed 9 out of 10 on the first guess. Once it was wrong but asked two more questions and guessed correctly. You have to actually know things about the animals so if you are not too swift or ignorant about animals, it can't guess your animal. For example, if your animal is a polar bear and it asks you if your animal can swim, if you say 'no,' it can't guess correctly--but that would be your fault not the app since polar bears can indeed swim. Similarly, if your animal is a hyena, and you say yes to 'is it a predator?' That is also going to mess it up since hyenas are scavengers. Like all software, garbage in garbage out. If you find the app isn't guessing your animals, it's probably you not the app. This app is killing it when you answer intelligently.","on June 5, 2017",4315377c-bba9-4b0b-ac59-9918b8df0e80,5.0 out of 5 stars,Animal Game,1504521521,Really fun,6 people found this helpful.

jjaquinta,0,"Ease of Use: 5 out of 5. The entire skill is implemented with only taking ""yes"" and ""no"" for an answer. A pretty good achievement. I also like that it occasionally interjects a non-gameplay comment like ""Hmm. What could it be."" It makes the interface more personable.Usefulness: 3 out of 5. It's pretty simplistic. And some questions don't easily have a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. I'm familiar with the general game as one of the first old text-based games to demonstrate machine learning. However, unlike those implementations, this doesn't actually have the capacity to learn new animals. Given Alexa's difficulty with accepting free form text, it's understandable.Novelty: 4 out of 5. The game isn't new, but it is a very clever use of Alexa's strengths, but avoiding its weaknesses. It was written by an Amazonian, they may have been watching in frustration at the fairly simple skills being done and took matters into their own hands.Overall: 4 out of 5. It's a good skill, and I'll probably keep it enabled for a while. It's a hit with my kids.

Justin M.,0,"Alexa recommended this skill when asked to play a game. Little did we know that this would be one of the best experiences yet had on our Echo. This skill is a true classic mystery adventure game featuring high quality sound effects and voice acting coupled with a rich, in depth interactive story. The goal is to solve the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. In doing so you are faced with several paths and choices. Each path goes surprising deep; leading you to believe that you are on the right path only to reach a dead end.It actually took us around 30 minutes to solve the murder and every second was very enjoyable. ""The Wayne Investigation"" will undoubtedly be one of best experiences you will have with your Echo device.

Reasonable Reviewer,2,"I'm a fan of text based gaming, and I've played Zork and Colossal Cave (and compiled my own FORTRAN adventures in the day). So, I was excited to see this App. Alas, there are some significant issues that suck away the fun.You have a limited set of commands, and that is OK.  You first hurdle is getting Alexa to understand you. There is no ""rest"" or ""camp"" capability.  So, when you're down to your last life points and Alex misunderstands you, costing your life, it is very, very frustrating.You can BUY weapons, armor, potions, and spells. You have to EQUIP the weapons and armor.Then, you can maneuver using N E S W commands.The structure of the dungeon doesn't change from adventure to adventure, but the monsters change.  There are two types, fixed and wandering.Combat is tedious.  You ATTACK or BLOCK high, middle, or low. Then, see if you successfully block or attack. A single round against the first encounter can last more than five minutes.If you live (you probably won't), you can take any treasure. If you're fortunate enough to get back to town with enough gold, you might be able to purchase a healing potion.  Otherwise, you're stuck with the wounds you have even if you make it back to town.There are no clever strategies for sure fire beating particular monsters as there were in Zork, CC, etc., and a kobold is just as likely to attack high as is a giant spider. So, forget about strategies.This could have been a lot of fun, but the current instantiation is just frustrating between the voice command recognition challenges, the lack of rest/recovery options, the tedium of the combat, and the lack of ability to influence the game based on strategy/knowledge of the opponents.There is potential for a much better Version 2.0 though.","on January 23, 2017",37fcbd7b-bc70-439c-a7be-e215934a3273,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dungeon Adventure,1504522313,"Such a great idea, but the execution kills it (cue groans)",17 people found this helpful.
Mrs Zed,2,This is a great idea. I can be cleaning and playing in adventure game at the same time which is very cool. That said it would be nice if there were a command to turn off the long explanations.

Wraith3845,1,"the game is a bit tedious when it comes to combat but i can get over that pretty quickly, whats impossible to get over is that there is no way to rest and heal while in a dungeon or while in town unless you are at a critical life level, then the tows folk will take pity on you and let you rest at the inn but that it not an option you have it can only be offered by the towns folk. all healing must be done with potions while in the dungeon which is a problem at lower levels because, you need to spend gold on a weapon and armor if you want to survive, this is compounded even farther when you use a spell to teleport you back to town, when you return to the main entrance and have to navigate all the way back to where you left off in the dungeon (there is no way to teleport back to your last location you have to hump it). after all that this is still not my main complaint, my main complaint is that accurate mapping is almost IMPOSSIBLE. you hear things like ""large room"" or ""long corridor""with no way to measure so as far as you know a ""long corridor""  could be anywhere from 25 feet long to 100 miles long. this also goes for rooms, a ""large room"" could be 40x40 or 400,000x400,000. i'm assuming the creator of this game has an idea what graph paper is (at least i hope so) and standard gaming practice is that 1 square on a standard sheet of graph paper is 10'x10' so how about instead of ""a large room"" you give the room detentions or give the option to ask for room detentions that way you're not  killing a small forest with paper usage from redrawing maps over and over and over and over.......................................................................................................and over.......................................","on July 1, 2017",5f9e3437-75ee-41e2-b6eb-9e190f73c87d,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dungeon Adventure,1504522314,the game is a bit tedious when it comes to combat but i can get ...,One person found this helpful.
seth,1,"This game is a great idea, but its got some flaws that keep it from being epic. first you can't sell items. Second the battle system is very slow. over all however, its a very good game and challenging! Very challenging! You will die many times trying to figure out how best to tackle the dungeon. I would also recommend having graph paper so you could draw out the rooms and hall ways you have been to. You navigate around with the N,S,E,W commands and sometimes it can be a little confusing after you have gone through a lot of rooms to figure out where you have not been.","on March 27, 2017",0f005f3f-3e67-4868-83f8-54eae8ecf132,4.0 out of 5 stars,Dungeon Adventure,1504522314,"Good, but could be great!",4 people found this helpful.

Kelly Aman,1,"It's a simple enough dungeon crawl, but the combat tends to get a bit tedious with the lengthy descriptions. Additionally, it feels like drawing a map would be necessary as you travel through corridors to bland rooms with doors going off in various directions. It's fine in the moment, but if I take a break, I'd have to way of reorienting myself.

Elyse Groccia,0,"So being an avid d & d player thought this would be a lot of fun and easy to play. First rule in any game don't kill the player twice in the first 5 minutes of the game. After rolling my characters  I went the warrior route because it's always the easy way to play any adventure type game unless you are playing something like White Wolf were talking is more important than fighting. Well due to the blocking system which seems to favor the monsters. 33% chance to block (no RPG except for console based games were you can move allow blocking) seemed to be more like 75% for them and 25% or lower for me. The monsters armor class starting our is way too high. You want the beginning to be easy and make it harder as you go farther in, not good luck hope got a 16 or higher and put it in strength. Even with having more than double the hit points of what I was fighting I died quickly because I could not hit what I was fighting and it was too easy for what I was fighting to hit me. They had to roll a 10 to hit me but I had to roll a 13 or higher. This goes back to having to have a 16 in str to have any hope of hitting anything. Also how does dex not impact your ability to hit and strength add to damage? These things need to be fixed in order for me to play. Get rid of the blocking and make it easier at the beginning or like me you get people who will rage quit because it's too hard. As a DM I always started with easy monsters first not here's an orc mage hope you live.","on July 3, 2017",1bcf0258-5d91-40c4-9a13-c6852a13ffbd,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dungeon Adventure,1504522320,... d player thought this would be a lot of fun and easy to play,0
Amazon Customer,0,"This game deserves a 5 for the richness of options it offers, you can pick and choose your battles by listening outside rooms and running from fights.  There are more various monster types than I was expecting and some monsters have special abilities such as trolls can regenerate health on their turn rather than attack.  This all makes the game more interesting.The weakness of the game is the bugs and issues with the Alexa interface.  The game has often crashed or exited on me when Alexa mishears my command and does something weird like a bing search - this is made even more frustrating when the game hasn't autosaved before this crash.  But the fault is more with the platform itself than the game so I'm not going to deduct a star, there's room for improvement but overall a good and fun game to play if you can tolerate the slow pacing.","on January 29, 2017",793421d4-84a8-487a-80fa-df0a56c6c31d,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dungeon Adventure,1504522320,Good game,One person found this helpful.

charles a nyce,1,"It's a fun game but 2 things kill it for me.  1)I agree with the other  people in saying that the combat is very ""wordy"".  They could do without the long sentences that kill the momentum of the battles.  It shouldn't take 30 seconds to cast 1 spell because you have to hear all of the stuff you have heard 15 times already.  2) The randomizer is an absolute disaster. I just went 13 rounds with the creature guessing where i was attacking every time and when I did finally get through almost never rolled over a 10.  I kept track of all of the rolls for several battles.  The 6 sided dice rolls with a potential of close to 600 points i scored 253.  On the 20 sided, 27 rolls, I rolled a ""1"" 7 times and rolled a ""20"" only once but the worst is that of the 27 times I only rolled over a ""13"" 5 times.  When you die it's the worst.  To get revived the first time you need to roll and ""11"" I believe.  Now all of my characters have had a +2 or more to that roll and none of them have been revived.  So between never being able to get a good roll and the wordy long drawn out combat I have to say good game but just needs some tweeks to make it fun.","on June 4, 2017",7de13f1f-ee96-4146-aea2-c11f6b57ba9c,3.0 out of 5 stars,Dungeon Adventure,1504522321,good game but just needs some tweeks to make it fun,6 people found this helpful.

I went legally blind a little over five years ago, and I thought my days of playing strategy games were over, but the Echo changed that. This game has all the classic elements of DND ??armor, spells, potions, weapons, and some pretty vicious monsters (although a dragon, a gorgon, or a golden might help to break up some of the repetetiveness). The mindflayer, in particular, is a nice touch. I have gotten as far as killing two liches right now, but I haven't found the Necromancer. It would be nice if you could get a drink or a bed at the inn for a few coins, but for tight now all you can do in the town is let the people fix your injuries and buy armor, weapons, spells and potions in the shop. The WORST part is the VERY LONG time it takes to cast spells, but that could be edited down.

James Michael Elmore,1,"I've played 3 characters... the forced association of points makes for flawed gameplay. Have the game roll a set of results and then allow me to choose where I want to apply them. Secondly, during combat, there doesn't need to be a contious repetition of spel description and action, the first time is great, but a simple you cast magic missle, you rolled a 10 but needed a 12. Would suffice. Also all 3 playthroughs the monsters never rolled below a 14 but I rarely rolled above a 10.

Ms. Vida,1,"I played this game six times, and the only thing that was consistent was how overpowered the enemies were for such a weak PC. I never started with more than 30 gold, which meant I could either by a weapon or by armor, but not both, unless I went into the dungeon. I could not get past two monsters before I had to flee back to town for partial healing, and maybe by armor to raise my natural AC of 8 to 10 (if I was lucky).Very cool idea but the unbalanced system and the slow and very repititive voice system made this game annoying and not worth a continued effort to slay the necromancer.","on June 29, 2017",7f3cd1f6-f9fb-4a1f-8f2f-b747f18dc07f,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dungeon Adventure,1504522352,"Overpowered Enemies, Weak PC",0

Angie,0,"My daughter and I had a lot of fun competing with each other. You do need a piece of paper and pen to keep track of the cases you have left to open, but that was fine with us. We just wrote numbers 1-20 on a piece of paper. Each time we opened a case we wrote down the amount that was in it. The 1st time we both went all the way to the end without accepting any offers. She won $10 and I won 1 cent. The next time we played, we accepted a deal we would have accepted if we were playing for real. She won $41, 670, and I won $180,376. It was a quick, easy game, that is different every time. We thought it was fun.","on July 13, 2017",892448f5-d9b9-40eb-b2e1-39ed1ae5f855,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deal or No Deal Game (unofficial),1504522508,Very Entertaining!!,3 people found this helpful.

Robin McDonald,1,"Fun and I am glad to have it on Alexa but it would get a five star on a video version of Alexa. The problem being you really need to be able to see which cases you picked already. So you have to remember on your own. It very smartly added a 'random' choice for when you forget everything you picked. But ultimately you want to make your choices randomly yourself.  I found myself doing near number sequences to help keep track. Technically it doesn't matter, but part of the fun of the game is you want to pick the case based on a feeling about it. Still its a fun version and Alexa chats with the dealer on the phone like in the TV show. So big thumbs up for this one.","on August 3, 2017",e7486e60-a4f9-46e5-8925-c66426605cc9,4.0 out of 5 stars,Deal or No Deal Game (unofficial),1504522508,Well done but can't quite be done perfectly without seeing your picks.,One person found this helpful.

She also gets confused if more than one person answers at a time, and she just shuts down and it ruins the game. It would be better if she just could say ""please repeat"" or ""I didn't understand"".Overall though, we love it.

Larry45,0,"I enjoy this game and play at least a couple times a day.  The key is to understand how it works - the ""cave"" is nothing more than a 5x5 grid.  Picture in your mind a big square, and within that square are 25 little squares, or ""rooms.""  The object is to move around the cave, one room at a time, until you find the yeti.  If you hear the yeti roar, he is in one of the rooms adjacent to you.  Your job is to then determine which room he is in and kill him with the spear.  If you think he is in the room north of you, say, ""Throw the spear north.""  At that point you either kill the yeti or you don't, and the game is over either way.As you move around the cave by saying, ""Move south"" (or north or east or west) you may encounter a room with bats that can pick you up and move you to another part of the cave.  You'll also encounter some rooms with a large pit that will kill you if you enter that room.  You need to move carefully around the cave, picturing in your mind where you are within that big square and its 25-room grid.  When you locate the yeti, a little deductive reasoning will tell you exactly which room he is in and allow you to kill him with the spear.  It's fun; give it a try!","on December 26, 2016",91c00877-fcb3-402a-884c-af1ccbb702e3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hunt the Yeti,1504523208,A Very Fun Game!,15 people found this helpful.
Adrian,0,"Hunt the Yeti is an interpretation of Hunt the Wumpus, an early text based computer game. Since the original Wumpus game runs inside a command line, the Alexa version reads out the options and players can say commands to play the game. It works fantastically well by receiving actions and describing the current room. The sound effects are a nice touch to add to the environment of the game, which play when something is nearby or an event happens.This game works essentially the same as Wumpus with the gameplay format and room descriptions being the very similar, with the difference being that this is audio based and can take in voice commands. The result is a fun experience just like the original game with easy to use commands, with some nice touches like sound effects to heighten the experience as an interactive game.","on November 7, 2016",1a07caa1-a61b-456f-81cd-4969f26fae39,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hunt the Yeti,1504523208,Great port of Hunt the Wumpus,7 people found this helpful.

And to the developer: please remove slashes and other unnecessary punctuation that is confusing when Alexa names the punctuation; remember, we are LISTENING to it, not reading it. And remove odd abbreviations or other words that Alexa can't pronounce understandably. I also think it would be possible to program it not to lead off with some questions that are almost never answered ""yes"".

Robin McDonald,0,"I want to support the game but while Akinator, the game it is based on is a fantastic port on android and mac devices its quite a failure on Alexa.Its really stupid.  Akinator on android amazingly guesses any character in a reasonably short time. This one which you can call Abra or Akinator takes about a hundred questions and then ends up guessing wrong pretty much every time.  Equally bad though it will quit if you are not fast enough or sometimes for no  obvious reason at all. Pretty frustrating when you have answered about seventy questions as I did for my character Bob's Big Boy.  This is however a perfect game for Alexa and I hope they will make it smarter.  The problem isn't the game, its the execution.","on August 3, 2017",81e51234-c418-4cc8-bd7c-735e2783639f,2.0 out of 5 stars,Abra,1504523398,"You can ask to play Akinator, but it sure doesn't play like Akinator.",0

Wasted Youth,0,"Like others have mentioned, it doesn't seem to be as intelligent as the app. Its database may not be as extensive. And I suspect that it mistakes the answers sometimes due to verbal inconsistencies. But it's still great for passing the time. One huge improvement that would solve a wealth of complaints would for Alexa to verify the guess was correct rather than assuming she has solved it. The virtual mic drop she does currently is infuriating. ""I think I've got it. You are thinking of <not what I was thinking>."" And then she just leaves the building. There's no closure. That's annoying. Please, please, add the ability to continue the session if she guesses wrong.On a more positive note, we were about 30 questions in tonight, and she was all out in left field. I knew either she was about the guess wrong or stop, as she sometimes does after the game goes on too long.Instead, she suddenly guesses correctly.

Nooo, you just told it it lives in the USA.Similarly, it will ask if your character is a girl say yes and 2 or 3 questions later might ask if your character has a beard. It doesn't appear to weed out possibilities as it should with the answers it receives, and it does this over and over, making a session that a human probably could have guessed in 10 questions a marathon of 30.For some odd and annoying reason, almost every character guessing session is started by ""Is your character Indian"" ? followed by ""Is your character a famous youtuber ?""

In the Alexa skill, players answer questions about the person or character they are thinking of. You can answer yes or no to these questions or use other similar words, which makes question answering more fluid. In my experience with the web version of Akinator, the genie is insanely accurate when it comes to guessing what I'm thinking, and the skill has the same strong intelligence as well. Some games may take a long time with the amount of questions asked which is similar to the online game's option to answer more questions if the genie didn't guess correctly.

betinil,0,"This skill started out great - the first four times I used it, she either guessed it or came very close.  She missed one but that was because she misunderstood one of my answers. It would be nice to have the option to confirm or deny that she is correct on her guess.  She just made the statement as to who the person was, and didn't give me a chance to tell her that she was incorrect.  (Must be nice to just assume that you are always right!)  I used it for the first time last night.  Today when I went to play a round, Alexa replied, ""Sorry, I'm having trouble accessing your Abra skill right now.""

Tig,0,"As expected, the boast that it can guess ANY character no matter how obscure is just hot air: the game failed at both Nicole des Jardines (saying it was Madame Bovary) and Richard Wakefield (saying it was some Japanese name), both of Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee's later books in the Rama series. It correctly guessed Steven Universe and even Vidalia, both of Steven Universe, and Jonas from The Giver (though it just said ""Jonas"" with no other clarification). When thinking of Michael Collins, she guessed Neil Armstrong :(The app itself could use some upgrades. When asked to repeat a question (""Alexa, repeat""), she just asks another question. I'm not even sure if my ""I don't know""s are being counted as that, or as ""no""s. Finally, some of the questions are redundant: after saying the character was not an animal, she asked if they were a wolf; after saying a character had a son, she asked if they had kids. When trying to guess for the Apollo 11 command module pilot Michael Collins, after confirming he is a real person and an astronaut, she asked if he was in the Justice League! She then asked if he was dead, twice (he is not), and then asked if he had a natural death.","on August 13, 2016",1a17a9e4-e5f0-4aff-bb71-5223166ef2d8,3.0 out of 5 stars,Abra,1504523492,"Good at popular franchises only, needs some updates",2 people found this helpful.

How about a full database of item specs. Maybe Alexa could be a raid sherpa. Oh! upcoming public event locations and times. Finally, I would enjoy Alexa reading my the Grimoire contents.The point I was trying to make with the previous paragraph is that with the current feature set, I could see getting complacent and eventually forgetting about the skill eventually.

jjaquinta,0,"This skill is a slightly simpler version of the ""Higher or Lower"" game from a few weeks ago.Ease of Use: 5 out of 5. The skill is very simple to use. All you do is repeat numbers to it. I tried messing with it by using negative numbers or decimals, but it caught it. It even passed the ""fishwife"" test. It's hard to go wrong.Usefulness: 3 out of 5. This is mostly a demonstration game. It really isn't engaging enough for a lot of repeat play (unless you are a certain age).Novelty: 2 out of 5. I've been assuming Amazon has not released my ""Knock Knock"" joke skill because they already have similar functionality. But here they've released a skill nearly identical to another one. That and this being the third number game there rates it low for novelty.Overall: 4 out of 5. Although having less features than ""Higher or Lower"", it plays better because it is more focused. It also rates higher than ""Math Puzzles"" by being actually playable. I would like to see a future version where the responses are a bit more varied. Slightly different phrases for ""too high"" and ""too low"" would improve engagement. Giving hints like ""Oh, so close! But still too high"" boost it even more.","on December 4, 2015",f4eb601e-c22a-4460-bb35-cb4cc58c2c82,4.0 out of 5 stars,Guess The Number,1504523957,It really isn't engaging enough for a lot of repeat play,One person found this helpful.

jjaquinta,1,"This is an Echo front end to the Fantasy Football Nerd website. This uses ""Nerd Rank"" technology to crowd source ratings. They're good enough to be quotes as ""the Cliffs Notes of the Industry"" by The Washington Post in 2009.Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. It's pretty simple, you can just ask for news, or about a certain player. It was better than I expected with the player names. It did crash once, but it got all the others I tried right. When it reads the general news, it is in several segments. It can get kind of long. It would have been nice if it was split up and you could cycle through them conversationally. Player news is also in segments, but the gap between them is less clear. This can create some confusion as one news update runs into the next. Also, the text comes straight from their site, and occasionally it reads web-links, which is confusing and unhelpful.Usefulness: 3 out of 5. I know almost nothing about Fantasy Football. But this skill seems more of a Football news source rather than much to do about Fantasy Football. That's great for football fans. I don't know how great that is for Fantasy Football fans. Perhaps it should have been marketed more towards mainstream football enthusiasts.Novelty: 3 out of 5. It's another ""read the news to  you"" skill. The news appears to be high quality and relevant for the topic. But it really is just about the news.Overall: 3 out of 5. It's fairly specific in it's appeal, although, admittedly, football is rather popular. I'd like to see them add in more interaction and connect with the gameplay of Fantasy Football itself. There are several tools on the web site and I think the skill will improve greatly if they integrate those in going forward.","on December 4, 2015",f119859d-7825-48a1-97df-f7a299d04ba1,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fantasy Football,1504523996,More of a Football news source rather than much to do about Fantasy Football,14 people found this helpful.

jjaquinta,0,"This, long awaited skill, is a simple ""fortune cookie"" delivering Elizabethan insults.Ease of Use: 4 out of 5. As with all ""fortune cookie"" skills, the interface is minimalist. Hard to go wrong. The only real improvement that could be made is for a slight pause between the insult, and the reference. I know this skill has been waiting in the queue for a while. Back when it was written, you couldn't add in  a pause. So hopefully it will be in the next revision.Usefulness: 3 out of 5. This is kind of fun. I like the concept, but Alexa's pronunciation of Elizabethan English makes it a little hard to savor the biting wit of English's most famous playwright. But, unlike most skill, I'll probably keep this one enabled.Novelty: 3 out of 5. Fortune cookie skills are pretty plentiful. And there really isn't a lot of scope to grow this one much. But it's a cut above, say, Edgar Facts. (Well, honestly, what wouldn't be?)Overall: 4 out of 5. It's nice to see something a little more classical out there. The anachronism of listening to 400 year old prose spoken by cutting edge software is worth the price alone! A truly stunning encore would be to tailor Alexa's reading of his sonnets, with appropriate pauses, to give perfect delivery. That would be rather a labor of love, though. Hmm. Maybe I'll try it with one of mine.","on December 4, 2015",46012618-c8e8-4b73-a118-308e78008f13,4.0 out of 5 stars,Angry Bard,1504525303,Nice to see something a little more classical out there,2 people found this helpful.

Ed B,0,"The best Alexa adventure game I've played yet.  Magic Door and Wayne Investigations were great, but they were too short and not as interactive as this game is.  I like this game for the following reasons:1) The game guides you but doesn't spell everything out.  In order to solve the mystery, you need to try to do things that you are not prompted to do.  This a happy balance between the other games I've played where they either tell you everything or don't give you enough direction.  I disovered the game will also give you instructive hints if you say 'Hint'.  Be careful, you might be tempted to say Hint at every scene and get an escort through the game, but try to resist this... There is no fun in having someone else solve it for you:)2) The game lets you use items to further your mission and has actions that are dependent on other actions.  This makes the game more interactive and fun the others I've played.3) The game adapts to how you want to play.  There are settings to make the descriptions more brief or verbose. This is handy because hearing the same full description again and again can get monotonous.Things I would like to see added:1) More games!  But it sounds like that is the plan.2) More voice overs.  Adding more voice overs like Wayne Investigations would make this game even more fun!Great work!","on April 13, 2017",723bc82f-9c23-4450-b8e5-b23a4e74c41c,5.0 out of 5 stars,Timeless Adventure,1504525844,Great Game,6 people found this helpful.

I played a 3rd game just to be sure n results were the same difference as between 1st, n 2nd game [3 new, 2 repeats].

Law,0,"The facts are very general and deal mostly with statistics about the playerbase or game size. As well, the skill appears to be truly random which means you might hear the same fact multiple times in a row. I'd like it if the algorithm restricted repeats for a short time.As far as content, I wish the facts included story information, raiding progression information (ie: Guild X was the first to kill Onyxia in Y year.), and so forth. The facts are underwhelming currently.Lastly, it would be a huge improvement if the skill didn't automatically stop after each fact. I wish Alexa would ask ""Would you like to hear another?""

jjaquinta,0,"Had a lot of confusion linking, but that was all Google's fault. It's a pretty clever idea, linking services like this. However, there is no option to choose which printer to use, and there is no confirmation that it's heard what you said. The first time I asked it to print &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;, it said it would print &quot;Battle Angel&quot;, and I got a picture of Joshua destroying the walls of Jerico. The second time I asked it to print &quot;Snoopy&quot;, it said it would print &quot;Newt&quot;, and I got a picture of Christmas mittens. The third time I asked for &quot;Road Runner&quot;, it said it would print &quot;Road Runner&quot; and I actually got Road Runner. One in three is not a high enough quality for me to use this regularly. I don't want to waste that much paper.A improvement would be for the skill to reply with &quot;Searching for 'what I heard'...

The game is so much fun regardless of how many quotes they supply you will play and play until you are getting quite a number of repeats.

Lisa522,1,"Really fun game but as the others said, there are certain ones where she will not accept the answer even if you say it EXACTLY as she does.  Also, certain movies - Misery and Kindergarten Cop, in particular- she never gets right.  For Misery, she will say Missouri... wrong.  It's Misery.  Duh, that's what I said!  For Kindergarten Cop, she always seems to think we're saying On The Garden Path Cop.  It's funny the first time she misunderstands but no matter how clearly you enunciate, she still gets it wrong with those movies.  Other movies (the majority), she gets correctly.  My husband has even SUNG the answer Goldfinger (to the movie's theme song) and she WILL accept that so there's hope, lol.  Please add more quotes and try to stick to WELL KNOWN movies as we play this game a lot and really enjoy it.PS - to the developers, a future project that would be great fun is naming a portion of a well known song's lyric and guess the song title.

Zack,0,"The skill is really great! I hoped someone would develop this. It is especially nice that it is on such a low chess ability setting since I am trying to play blindfold. It is also really neat that you can see the board in the Alexa app. Nice job with all of that!Unfortunately the app doesn't have much utility right now because you are only given a few seconds to make your move. If you take too long, the app stops and the game disappears forever. Also, if you say some short-hand notation like ""e4"" rather than saying ""pawn to e4"" the app does not understand and will often close out and delete the whole game. That is pretty frustrating.Important updates in order of priority:1. Allow infinite thinking time2. Fix the issue of closing the game when it doesn't understand your move.3. Improve the commands so it understands more normal chess communication like ""e takes d4"" or ""rook f d3""Fix those things and it gets 5 stars.","on January 5, 2017",fb912740-538e-4157-8636-16892d96edf9,3.0 out of 5 stars,Chesster,1504527834,Awesome skill.

T.H.,0,"The word recognition in this app is way off. It doesn't seem to be using Alexa's voice recognition software. You can mumble a bunch of words and it will come up with a bunch of words you didn't say. So the issue is that you can say the list correct and then she will say you said it wrong because she heard something different. If there is background talking it's even worse. Also, the skill doesn't give you enough time to think. It will say wrong if you pause for a sec after a word. The skill also talks too much once you get a word wrong. You should be able to say continue and keep going. The skill also asks if you want to repeat the list and you say yes and the app exits fairly frequently.

Di,3,"**8/18/17 UPDATE in the comments below - I Changed it to 5 star**I really like this game but it's incredibly frustrating! Alexa more often than not hears the wrong word and says you're wrong when you had it correct. One answer was 'cognizant', which I said, and Alexa said 'you said consummate'...really??? It's totally aggravating when I get up to the 6th question and that happens! Alexa either says I said the wrong answer or she can't understand my answer at all and says 'that was just mumbo jumbo. ..'and I have to repeat it over and over until I get so pissed that I just quit.

jjaquinta,0,"This is another skill from LME, who brought you Crystal Ball last week. This one is a little more to it.Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. The user interface for the game is pretty straightforward. It's easy to learn, but there are a few detracting points. Games can go on for quite a while. An actual bingo caller mixes it up a bit in how they tell you the number and column. This skill doesn't, and since the tone can't change, it gets a little monotonous. The other problem is that, although it's pretty good at recognition, you end up saying ""next"" enough times that it eventually gets it wrong. After that, it's game over. There's no way to restart a game. Same thing happens if the skill crashes in the middle, or you are pulled away for a moment. That last quibble is that the text on the card is clearly the same text that gets read out. You can tell because it is punctuated to put in pauses for the speech synthesis. It would have been a nice touch if the card text was formatted for reading.Usefulness: 4 out of 5. If you like Bingo, then it's great. If you don't, you needn't bother. I can see you keeping a table of a few kids of exactly the right age entertained with this for a while. But it's a little hard. Any chatter is going to confuse Alexa and reset the game. But, for the right age, that just adds to the gameplay.Novelty: 3 out of 5. It is an interesting enough idea. In my search for simple games that work for the Echo, I never thought of this. The execution is straightforward though. No particularly nifty lessons to take home and apply to your own skills.Overall: 4 out of 5. Bingo is a solid player app for The Echo. If you like it, you'll probably use it a lot. If you don't, you won't.","on December 4, 2015",6f672834-ad8a-4c1a-b672-251ec41a3ac4,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bingo,1504530462,"If you like Bingo, then it's great.

Kawfy,0,"This is really nice for family fun and for my elderly father who loves Bingo but can no longer get out.  There are a few drawbacks, like having Alexa quit a game upon hearing a cough :(  So don't play if you have a cold.  There should be a pause, if there is a distraction (phone/doorbell etc.) and then the game can resume without losing place.

jjaquinta,0,"This is another skill from LME, who brought you Crystal Ball last week. This one is a little more to it.Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. The user interface for the game is pretty straightforward. It's easy to learn, but there are a few detracting points. Games can go on for quite a while. An actual bingo caller mixes it up a bit in how they tell you the number and column. This skill doesn't, and since the tone can't change, it gets a little monotonous. The other problem is that, although it's pretty good at recognition, you end up saying ""next"" enough times that it eventually gets it wrong. After that, it's game over. There's no way to restart a game. Same thing happens if the skill crashes in the middle, or you are pulled away for a moment. That last quibble is that the text on the card is clearly the same text that gets read out. You can tell because it is punctuated to put in pauses for the speech synthesis. It would have been a nice touch if the card text was formatted for reading.Usefulness: 4 out of 5. If you like Bingo, then it's great. If you don't, you needn't bother. I can see you keeping a table of a few kids of exactly the right age entertained with this for a while. But it's a little hard. Any chatter is going to confuse Alexa and reset the game. But, for the right age, that just adds to the gameplay.Novelty: 3 out of 5. It is an interesting enough idea. In my search for simple games that work for the Echo, I never thought of this. The execution is straightforward though. No particularly nifty lessons to take home and apply to your own skills.Overall: 4 out of 5. Bingo is a solid player app for The Echo. If you like it, you'll probably use it a lot. If you don't, you won't.","on December 4, 2015",be1aea25-f868-4ed6-b0ac-5e189b01fa85,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bingo,1504530488,"If you like Bingo, then it's great.
