Was it in the same session? or it happened when you played a new game? Our database of questions is pretty large and it is programmed to not ask the same questions again while you are playing. However if you start a new game there is a chance it might ask the same question again. I will look into how we can make it better so no duplicate questions even when you start a new game.

DBJ,"Thanks for your feedback. You can skip the ""intro"" my telling Alexa your move in the following manner: ""Alexa, ask chess master to move [piece] to [coordinate]."" The intro/music will only play if you open the skill without specifying a move (the skill assumes that you have been away for a while and need to see the board, so it plays the intro and sends a picture of the board to your phone). I can see how this can be frustrating, and I'll look to make this more intuitive in later releases.And to your point about quick moves.... we went back and forth on allowing quick moves (e.g. - waiting for a response, instead of closing the user interaction and requiring the using the ""activate"" the skill again for the next move).

chris,"Thanks for using the app! Let me assure you that each player has an equal chance be selected. The app will select a random number between 1 and the number of players that you specify. For your example of 3 players, the player that invoked the application is considered player 1, and is referred to by the app as ""the player who asked."" The other players are 2 and 3, and are identified by their location around the table relative to player 1. Be sure to note whether the app is counting off to the left or the right of the first player. The app can give you either direction to count off (left or the right from the player who asked), but will always select the direction that minimizes the number that needs to counted off. If player 3 is selected they will be identified as ""the first player to the right of the person who asked"", and not as ""the second player to the left of the person who asked"", even though you could count off both ways and land on the same person.That may be trivial for a 3 player game, but the app supports up to 19 players and I thought it would be ridiculous to have it say ""the 18th person to the left of the player who asked"" instead of ""the first player to the right of the player who asked.""I hope that helps to clear things up.

A Customer,"Thanks for taking the time to provide a review of our Alexa skill.  We're disappointing it didn't work to your expectations.  We'd love for you to give it another try.  We'll look to make the instructions a bit more clear.  You're not able to only say ""Clue"" since there is the 1985 movie called Clue, so you need to say ""I need a clue"" or something similar. Alternatively you can use the term ""hint"".  As for your other concerns, we leverage the standard Alexa protocols for request/response (Alexa only listening after the quote is finished), along with their exit protocols (exit, cancel, stop, quit) .Thanks again.

Di,"Hi Drew, thank you so much for your response!! I HAVE noticed that Alexa is understanding better. I still get a little aggravated with plurals/tenses, like I answered a word that should have ended in -ing, based on how the question was asked and she said I was wrong and the correct word was singular, but I know this is what it is, it can't be perfect. You really got me when I answered a question with the word 'Oasis', she said 'you said tuberculosis' - I started yelling at my little Alexa device (lmao!!) and she said 'take a chill pill, I know you didn't say tuberculosis, you said oasis' - that was awesome! It happened with another word too, on my 9th question, so I didn't freak out... But overall I really like it and play it a bit obsessively actually, lol!

This has considerably reduced the number of mishears.I’m ultimately dependent on Amazon for the voice recognition - but from the feedback I’m starting to get I can see there has been a big improvement.If you think I’m going in the right direction then a higher star rating would be much appreciated!Thanks again.Drew",17 days ago,006dd411-e7fb-4756-aa53-918690983193,This game is really fun,1504529366.382164
