R. Seehoffer,1,"The skill itself isn't bad--in fact I used it for a couple months without issue. My concern is that the pin code necessary to access account information, pay bills, etc is stored as plain text in Alexa's voice history list, and can be read by anyone who looks. 99% of people are not going to know how to go on Amazon through their PC and clear that history, or scroll through hundreds of entries and delete it from the Alexa app. This to me pretty much negates the security aspect of requiring a pin, and so I removed the skill.","on January 10, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Capital One,1503582420.5800736,"Not a bad skill, but access pin is readable by anyone, even months after the fact.",27 people found this helpful.

With this app, I actually have to tell Alexa to stop. 5. Spammy. After I do successfully (phew!) stop the app, I hear a ""Thank you for using Fidelity Investments"". This is really annoying.
